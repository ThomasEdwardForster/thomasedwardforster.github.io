I dreamed of him last night, I saw his face
<br>All radiant and unshadowed of distress
<br>and as of old, in music measureless
<br>I heard his golden voice and marked him trace
<br>under the common thing the hidden grace
<br>and conjure wonder out of emptiness
<br>till mean things put on beauty like a dress
<br>and all the world was an enchanted place
<p>
And then methought outside a fast locked gate
<br>I mourned the loss of unrecorded words
<br>forgotten tales and mysteries half said
<br>wonders that might have been articulate
<br>and voiceless thoughts like murdered singing birds
<br>and so I woke and knew that he was dead.

Small prize for guessing who wrote this, and about whom.  Well, very<br>
small prize actually, co's it's pretty obvious. You can date the poem<br>
by the style. The rest is&mdash;well&mdash;history.  The only slight
surprise is<br>
that the much vilified author seems to have had something good in him.<br>
Perhaps we shouldn't really be surprised: there is some good in most of us,<br>
and the poet is not ashamed to admit to falling under Oscar's spell.<br>
I think Oscar must have been not only charming but also very very lovable.
