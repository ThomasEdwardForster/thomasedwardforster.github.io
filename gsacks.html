  ``Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. The subject of
Mathematical Logic splits fourfold into: recursive
functions, the heart of the subject; proof theory,
which includes the best theorem in the subject; sets
and classes, whose romantic appeal far outweigh their
mathematical substance; and model theory, whose value
is its applicability to, and roots in, algebra.''

Absolutely, the correct take on Set Theory is that it is Romantic 
Nonsense, as Gerald Sacks says. [And I'm a Set Theorist!]  But it's not <i>just</i>
Romantic Nonsense, it's Romantic Nonsense of a highly specific time 
and place: Romantic Nonsense from that Wonderland that is the magic 
wellspring or perhaps the <i>thistlegrove</i> of Romantic Nonsense 
<i>par excellence</i>&mdash;the 1960s.  Back then there was Bob Solovay's 
famous&mdash;epoch-defining&mdash;single: ``2<sup>&#x2135;<sub>0</sub></sup> can be anything 
it ought to be''&mdash;in the 1965 Skolem Memorial Volume indeed . . . . 
my copy of which arrived in the same parcel as my copy of Cohen's 
concept album <i>Set Theory and the continuum Hypothesis</i> for the (<i>huge</i>!)  price of &pound;9/10s which would 
have bought four full-price LPs (what are LPs??) . . . .  in the summer 
of 1970.  Anything it ought to be indeed.  Love is all you need, after all.  That and 
Haight-Ashbury, Woodstock, the Axiom of Determinacy, miniskirts, Measurable 
Cardinals contradict <i>V=L</i>, Set Theory in The Cavern, the Chatterly 
trial, Sex, Drugs, Rock'n'roll and Large Cardinals, the Independence 
of CH, <i>forcing</i>(!), the Moon Landings, Concorde, Carnaby street, 
Yellow Submarine, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Charles Manson, 
Talk-ins, Love-ins, Monty Pyth-ins* . . . . .
<p>
<i>Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive<br>
and to be young&mdash;was very heavan</i>.<p>


Not that i can remember any of it of course!<p>


<i>Forcing began<br> in 1963<br> . . . . between the end of the Chatterly ban<br> and the Beatles' first LP.</i>
