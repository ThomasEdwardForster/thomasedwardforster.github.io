  In your skull you have a specimen of the most sensational
information-processing engine in the known universe.  Of your very
own! And you'd better learn how to use it, beco's&mdash;if you don't&mdash;it
won't go to waste . . . . . . .  someone else will use it, and quite
possibly not in a way that portends any good for you.

  This is what I always tell my students.  Something to do with the
  Parable of the Talents.  Refusing to use the brain wot The Good Lord
  gave you is a much more serious blasphemy than making Visual
  Representations of the Prophet or Taking the Name of the Lord in
  Vain. Those are internal disciplinary matters for members of the
  religions concerned, and are of no concern for non-subscribers; they
  do not correspond to fundamental facts about the Human Condition.  Squandering your talents is something
  that <i>all</i> of us need to avoid doing.
