Greg Restall:  Proof Nets for the Modal Logic S5

<p>



It turns out to be surprisingly straightforward to extend  
proof nets for classical logic to treat the operators of the simple  
modal logic S5. In this talk I explain just how you can do that, and  
-- furthermore -- how you can use the resulting proof nets to define  
a new, simple, cut-free sequent calculus for S5. Along the way I hope  
to explain why proof-nets are not merely technical devices but have  
philosophical application. (This talk motivates the results from the  
point of view of the philosopher interested in inference, but the  
connections to category theory and computation are not too far from  
the surface.)

Algebraic IFG-Logic
<p>

In <i>The Principles of Mathematics Revisited</i> (1996), Hintikka  
introduces independence-friendly logic (IF-logic), a conservative  
extension of first-order logic that allows a quantifier that falls  
within the syntactic scope of another quantifier to be independent of  
it. IFG-logic is a generalization of IF-logic introduced by Caicedo,  
Krynicki, and Dechesne. We present an algebraization of IFG-logic  
along the lines of cylindric algebra.

The Disjunction and Related Properties for Intuitionistic Set Theories
 <p>


The talk will be concerned with the disjunction
property, the numerical existence property, Church's
rule, and several other metamathematical  properties hold true
for Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory, CZF, and also for
the theory CZF augmented by the Regular Extension Axiom.

<p>

As regards the proof technique, it features a self-validating
semantics for CZF that combines realizability for extensional
set theory and truth. The technique applies to full intuitionistic
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, IZF, as well.

Cardinality and (sometimes) Functions in Three Types

<p>



In TT<sub>3</sub> (type theory with just three types) it is impossible
to define the usual (Wiener-Kuratowski) ordered pair so it appears
difficult to define functions, and defining functions seems to be a
conceptual prerequisite for defining cardinality of sets. However,
Henrard showed (in unpublished work) that cardinality can nonetheless
be defined in three types.  We show how it is possible to define
almost all functions in TT<sub>3</sub>, and always to define
equinumerosity of sets.  In the presence of a linear order on the
universe (a condition which can be expressed in the language of
TT<sub>3</sub>) it becomes possible to define an ordered pair and so
easily define functions and cardinals.  The details of the problem
with defining functions make it clear that what is needed to get a
full definition of functions is any principle that will allow choice
from an arbitrarily large collection of finite sets.  <p>

This sheds light on how much mathematics can be done 
in NF<sub>3</sub>, the fragment of Quine's New Foundations with full 
extensionality and all comprehension axioms that can be expressed in 
three types; we will allude to this but the talk does not depend in any 
way on knowledge of New Foundations.

If you want to come to the meeting tell tf@dpmms.cam.ac.uk so
we can get a good fix on numbers.  There will be a supper after the
meeting.  Definitely tell
tf if you wish to stay for this!
