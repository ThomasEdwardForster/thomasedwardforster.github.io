<i>The reason why we want more women in parliament and in cabinet
is nothing whatever to do with the rights of women; it's to do with
the rights of us all to have proper government.  If Woman's voice is
not heard at the Highest Councils in the land we <i>all</i> suffer.</i>

was a young radical (Tory!) MP in the 1970's and went on to be a significant
feminist writer, tho' not well-enough known outside her native New Zealand.
I heard her say this on the radio one morning and it struck me greatly.
I can't remember her exact words so this is a paraphrase.
<p>

I think this is a hugely important point deserving of wider application.
I want more women in my mathematical workplace, and it's worth asking on
what basis.  And it's not beco's there-not-being-enuff-women-in-university-mathematics violates rights of women;  which women?  <i>All</i> women?
Or the women who could make it there but for some reason don't? I don't
think that's the point at all. One banal point is that workplaces with a
gender balance are more fun, but surely more to the point is that if we
exclude women then we are perforce restricting ourselves to a smaller pool
of talent, and then we are all worse off.  Isn't that enuff of an argument?
<p>

I think this is incredibly important.  It means one can mount an
independent case for many of the demands of the feminists, a case that
doesn't make any appeal to talk about <i>rights</i>, and
it&mdash;arguably&mdash;goes to the heart of the real reason why we
agree with them.
<p>
I am very wary of rights-talk, for at least two reasons.  One is that
it's very hard to make it rigorous; (exactly whose rights are being
violated when something we don't like is happening?&mdash;see above)
and another is that i associate rights-talk with some nasty right-wing
agendas, often coming from You-Know-Where.
