<p> I found this appreciation of Granados' Goyescas the other day, from
the pen of Ernest Newman...
<p>


``The Goyescas are ... a fascinating work.  The music, for all the
fervour of its passion, is of classical beauty and composure.  The
harmony is rich but never experimental.  The melodies have new curves,
the rhythms new articulations.  Informing it all is a new grace, a new
pathos, a new melancholy.  Not only the separate pieces themselves but
the themes of them have a curious poetic individuality, so that to
meet in in a later piece with a theme from an earlier one is like
seeing a definite personality step across the scene; <i> but, above all,
the music is a gorgeous treat for the fingers, as all music is that is
the perfection of writing for its particular instrument.  It is
difficult, but is so beautifully laid out that it is always playable: one
has the voluptuous sense of passing the fingers through masses of
richly coloured jewels ...  it is pianoforte music of the purest kind.</i>''

(my italics). Clearly Ernest Newman was a good pianist!  Mortals such as your humble
correspondent can play (some of the) <i>Dansas Espanolas</i> but the
<i> Goyescas</i> are <i>hard </i>!  <p> Granados was a Schumann fan
(<i>obviously</i>); one wonders if Newmann appreciated Schumann as
much as he appreciated that **** toe-rag Wagner... (Adrian Mathias
tells me that Roger Scruton said of Schumann that he was the ``first
composer to write for the piano <i> as a piano</i>''. First equal with 
Chopin and Liszt I suppose .... at least if you ignore some Beethoven)
