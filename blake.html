<br>
To Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love
<br>
All pray in their distress
<br>
And to these virtues of delight
<br>
Return their thankfulness
<p>
For Mercy Pity Peace and Love
<br>
Is God our Father dear
<br>
And Mercy Pity Peace and Love
<br>
Is Man his child and care
<p>
For mercy has a human heart
<br>
Pity a human face
<br>
And Love, the human form divine
<br>
And Peace, the human dress
<p>
Then every man of every clime
<br>
that prays in his distress
<br>
Prays to the human form divine
<br>  Love Mercy Pity Peace.
<p>
And all must love the human form
<br> In heathen, Turk, or Jew;
<br>
Where Mercy Peace and Pity dwell<br>
There God is dwelling too.
<hr>Tenderness ......
Blake reminds us what we have to do if we want to be human&mdash;not that there was ever any mystery about it.   <p>
I love him; don't you..?
