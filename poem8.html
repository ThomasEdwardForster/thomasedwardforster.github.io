<p>

And again I see the long pouring headland, 
<br>
And smoking coast with the sea high on the rocks
<br>
The gulls flung from the sea, the dark wooded hills
<br>
Swarming with mist, and mist low on the sea.<br>

<br>
And on the surf-loud beach the long spent hulks
<br>
The mats and splintered masts, the fires kindled
<br>
On the wet sand, and men moving between the fires
<br>
Standing or crouching with backs to the sea
<br>

<br>
Their heads finely shrunken to a skull, small
<br>
And delicate,  with small black rounded beaks;
<br>
Their antique bird-like chatter bringing to mind
<br>
Wild locusts, bees and trees filled with wild honey&mdash;<br>

<br>

And, sweet as incense-clouds, the smoke rising, the fire
<br>
Spitting with rain, and mist low with rain&mdash;
<br>
Their great eyes glowing,  their rain-jewelled, leaf-green
<br>
Bodies leaning and talking with the sea behind them, 
<p>
Plant gods, tree gods, gods of the middle world ..... Face downward
<br>
And in a small creek mouth all unperceived, 
<br>
The drowned Dionysus,  sand in his eyes and mouth.
<br>
In the dim tide lolling&mdash;beautiful, and with the last harsh
<br>

<br>

Glare of divinity from lip and broad brow ebbing....
<br>
The long-awaited! And the gulls passing over with shrill cries;
<br>
And the fires going out on the thundering sand;
<br>
And the mist,  and the mist moving over the land
<br>

Like <A HREF ="poem1.html"> Iain Lonie </A>, Alistair Te Ariki
Campbell was (he died in 2009) a Kiwi classical scholar (with a
Scottish father) who wrote poetry.  Campbell had a Cook-Island mother&mdash;unlike Lonie&mdash;and his poetry is better known.<br> There is both
Polynesian and Classical input to this poem.  It is alleged to be a
visionary poem, like Kublai Khan, and the story told me was that it
was cacti from the greenhouse of the Auckland Domain that did the
trick.  Mind you, it's only a story and I haven't dared check it, in
case it turns out not to be true and then I would have to stop telling
it, wouldn't I??  <p> I think of this as a poem about a New Zealand
beach.  Beaches are utterly central to the Kiwi world view: New
Zealand is an Island civilisation, and when we stand on a beach we
know not only that it is a thing of great beauty (New Zealand is full
of beauty, after all&mdash;that is a given) but we know also that the rest
of the world lies beyond it, not across any land border.  Beaches
represent not only where we pick up shells&mdash;like Newton&mdash;but are
places whence we espy the Great Ocean of Truth that lies beyond(*).  The
pre-contact Maori knew, too, that there was a world beyond them that
they wished to come to know, and their Pakeha stepchildren live under
the same challenge: that is why New Zealanders are the world's
greatest travellers. <p> Perhaps one day someone will tell me what
this poem means....

The Beach At The End Of The World

``I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.''
