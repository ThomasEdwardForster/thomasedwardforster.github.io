Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel
<hr>

Dr Johnson <hr> There is a rather good remark of Richard Ingrams
about this. He says that this is not a fact about patriotism but a
fact about scoundrellism. You know what he means, and he's right of
course.  But no linguist/philosopher i know of has an analysis of
`aboutness' that gives a way of making this true. It reminds me a
bit of the challenge of making sense of the remark (by Ken Dodd's
lawyer at his trial for tax fraud) that<br>
``Some accountants are comedians but no comedians are accountants''
<p>
Find a way of formalising that that works!  And, while you are about it, explain why the film <i>Amadeus</i> is actually about Salieri not about Mozart.<hr>
