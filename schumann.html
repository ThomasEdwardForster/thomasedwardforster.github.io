<hr>
Nur erst, wenn dir die Form ganz klar<br>
ist, wird dir die Geist klar werden.

<p> (``Only when the form is clear to you will the spirit become
clear too'')<p> <hr>Robert Schumann <p> So it's true what they say about
Mathematics and Music.  What's odd about this observation (from the <i>
Album f&uuml;r die Jugend</i>) is that Schumann is commonly said to
have no sense of form.  So what is going on?  <p> 

Possibly connected to this (but again possibly not) is the remark of
Brahms' about Schumann.  ``All he ever taught me was how to play
chess!''  I got this last factoid from the introduction to
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegbert_Salomon_Prawer"> Siegbert
Prawer</A>'s <i> The Penguin Book of Lieder</i>.  I asked Prawer about
it, but he could not remember the source, and now &mdash; sadly &mdash; is no 
longer with us.  <hr>
