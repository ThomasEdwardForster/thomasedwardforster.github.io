Here are my <A HREF ="discretelectures.pdf">
        Lecture Notes on Discrete Mathematics</A>.        </FONT></TD> <p>  

<b>Health warning:</b><br>

These notes started off as <i>my</i> notes - for lecturing <i>from</i>
- when I was lecturing DM at Queen Mary - to Computer Science students
as it happens - and in making them available I am giving no
guarantees.  Word has reached me that Cambridge 1a CS students refer
to these notes, so I have tidied them up a bit. Notification of typos,
etc, suggestions for improvement, etc, will be received with thanks
and attract the usual rewards.<br>

They should be useful to 1a mathmos; the 1a course being followed by 
my CS readers is a cousin of 1a Numbers-and-Sets: years ago
CS Discrete Mathematics and Maths Numbers and sets were the same
course.  They probably still should be.  <hr> Here is a <A HREF
="Induction.pdf"> worked example of a proof by course-of-values
induction</A>, prepared by Frank King, and included with his
permission.  <hr> 
At some point i shall put here my discussion notes of Dr Wadsley's 2017 lectures.<br>
<hr>Here are my notes of <A HREF ="rachellectures.pdf"> Dr Camina's 1a Algebra lectures </A> from a couple of years ago.

<hr>Here is a <A HREF ="countability.pdf"> file </A>
that contains everything you need to know about countability.  It also
has some instructive exercises.  You can skip the appendix if you like
but you should definitely read everything before it. It has to be said
that Gareth Taylor thinks that they are too sophisticated for 1a maths
students.  I think he's wrong.  (He's not often wrong about paedogogy but we are none of us infallible)
