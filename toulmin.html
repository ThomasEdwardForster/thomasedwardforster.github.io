Ann Toulmin was my Godmother, a bombe girl at Bletchley (which was how
she came into my life &mdash; my father was at Bletchley).  A major
figure in my childhood, and a wonderful example of a powerful
liberated woman for a child to learn from.  No male child that grows
up with an Ann Toulmin in its life will ever feel threatened by
feminism: they will embrace it. (That's why role models are so
important). A highly intelligent woman with a sharp tongue and a mind
of her own.  Oh, yes. And a nice turn of phrase. I think that at one
point she had my father's old job as English <i>lektor</i> at the
University of Basel and lodged with my Grandfather and my aunts.
<i>Wonderful</i> company.  She was the older sister of Stephen Toulmin
(second-rate philosopher, now almost entirely forgotten.  In modern
times it would've been <i>she</i> not he who had the career and the
reputation).  Unlike him she never reproduced, which is a real
pity....though she did have a number of godchildren, some of whom i am still in touch with.  And she knew how to amuse children.  She had a large stock of jokes for us:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>WOMAN</b><i> (in low-cut</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dress) to </i> admiral  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see you're naval!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(in full regalia)</i><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ADMIRAL</b>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Madam, I can very nearly see yours<p>

I still have her
copy of Prout on Harmony....  <p> She worked in GCHQ and later in the
cabinet office and was the model for Sir Humphrey.  Well, all right,
she wasn't but she should have been.  She was not amused by `Yes
Minister'.  No thank you.  (Actually perhaps Sir Humphrey <i>was</i>
modelled on her after all . . . . this above remark of hers could
certainly have fallen &mdash; stingingly &mdash; from the lips of Sir
Humphrey).  She was never one to suffer fools gladly and she saw them
wherever she turned her gaze.  As long as our civil administration is
staffed by people like her we'll be all right. <p> I absolutely
<i>adored</i> her.
