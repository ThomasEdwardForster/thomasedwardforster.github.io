This book is written to the specifications of the syllabus committe
for the third year course in Logic given in the Mathematics Faculty at
Cambridge, and is based on the lecture notes from which I lectured it.
It is now lectured by <A HREF =
"http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/site2002/People/hyland_jme.html"> Martin Hyland </A>.  It starts off with background in discrete maths, then
has chapters on recursive datatypes, boolean logic, lattices and
fixed-point-theorems, predicate logic, computable functions, ordinals
and sets. There are exercises sprinkled throughout the text, and it ends with a chapter of worked answers to a selection of them. Despite this, it is not really recommended for self-study, but rather as an adjunct
for people who are attending a course of lectures in undergraduate
logic, since it grew also out of my supervision notes for this course.  In fact it ideally complements Peter Johnstone's ``Notes on
Set theory and Logic''.  To order it visit <A HREF =
"http://us.cambridge.org/titles/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521533619"> CUP
(New York) </A> (if you happen to be in the US) or <A HREF =
"http://titles.cambridge.org/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521533619"> CUP
(Cambridge) </A> if you are in the United Kingdom.  If you are in
Australia or lucky enough to be in New Zealand go to <A HREF =
"http://au.cambridge.org/result.asp?isbn=0521533619"> CUP in Melbourne
</A>.  Paperback and hardback both available.
