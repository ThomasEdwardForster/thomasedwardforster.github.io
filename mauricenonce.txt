Amend the scintillae file to include the story Maurice Knuckey told of
his representing serial flasher in a magistrate's court.  The
magistrate that tried him was female as it happens, and her primate
curiosity finally overcame her (tis was not the first time he had
appeared before her, so to speak) and she asked the question we all
want to ask: ``Why do you do it?''  and got the answer ``Co's i got a
big 'un''.

Well, you ask questions, you get answers; you may not know what they mean but you get them anyway.  Forty-two.
