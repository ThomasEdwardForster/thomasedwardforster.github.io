The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.
<hr>
Or, as we say nowadays, rules were made to be broken.
<p>But that of course is one half of a brace of slightly-more-than-half truths ....
the other one being that&mdash;other things being equal&mdash;one likes to do things by the book.

One of his better remarks, I've always thought.  So <i>humane</i>. Contumaceous atheist that I am I have
always had a pretty poor opinion both of this chap's followers and the
absurd beliefs they hold (not that you can't derive sense from nonsense,
as Hebel demonstrates in <A HREF ="kannitverstan.html"> <i> I can't understand you! </i></A>) who
seem to have started off as fruitcakes and were gradually hijacked by
bureaucrats.  (Hard to see which is worse, really).  However one has to
give <i> some</i> of them <i> some </i> credit at least: the person who
thought this remark worth recording and worth attributing cannot have
been wholly bad.
