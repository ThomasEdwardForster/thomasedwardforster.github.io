<br>
Nobody heard him, the dead man
<br>
But still he lay moaning
<br>
I was much further out than you thought
<br>
And not waving but drowning.
<br>

<br>
Poor chap, he always loved larking
<br>
And now he's dead
<br>
It must have been too cold for him his heart gave out
<br>
They said.
<br>

<br>
Oh, no no no, it was too cold always
<br>
(Still the dead one lay moaning)
<br>
I was much too far out all my life
<br>
And not waving but drowning.

Life's a bitch and then you die: it's one of the Four Noble Truths, isn't it.  <br> 
Or is it all four wrapped into one?  Dunno, guv. Even if she'd never written  <br> anything else
(and i don't really know anything else she wrote) we would  <br> love her 
for this forlorn little masterpiece.

I've been checking the internet literature on this poem, and it all seems to 
<br>me to be quite remarkably obtuse.   Surely it's obvious that this is a poem <br>about 
a suicidally depressive underachiever putting on a brave face....?<br>  Sometimes I wonder if this poem is a relative of Heine's <i>Wehmut</i>.... and <br> there is <A HREF ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aYpTbjBuqY"> the wonderful Schumann setting</A> ...
