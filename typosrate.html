<p>
The following typos have come to my notice so far:
<p>
p. 6 penultimate line of second para: delete second occurrence of `about'
<p>
p. 7 bottom of last line.  last word should be `from'.
<p>
p. 8    The sentence beginning on line 3 of the footnote has been decapitated.  It should read: ``This has resulted in some foolish radical-sceptical argumentation to the effect that correctness proofs can be of no effect.''

<p>
p 10.  The reference to Lederman-Vajda is to vol V (part B) of Wiley's Handbook  of Applicable Mathematics.
<p>
p 11 line -4.  Two `)' are missing in the set abstracts.

<p>
p 12 last line of first para: `and' should be `are'.
<p>
p. 36. First line of paragraph 3.2.3: the word `that' is missing after `philosophy'.
<p>
p 52 start of line 5 of the text. the `-' in the formula should be a `+'
<p>
p 79.  Penultimate line of the fifth paragraph: the italicised word `times' is of course meant to be a multiplication sign
