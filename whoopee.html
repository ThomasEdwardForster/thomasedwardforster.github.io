This is not a workshop; as Alexei Sayle says: <br>
``Anyone talking about going to a workshop who isn't engaged in light engineering is a wanker''
<p> We aim to have the first talk at 1130,
then break for lunch, and then have the remaining talks in the
afternoon.  I shall bring in some provisions for lunch; as for 
what we do about dinner, I am postponing a decision to nearer the time.
