Alone on the lawn <br>
The cabman dances <br>
In the dew of dawn <br>
he kicks and prances <br>
<p>
His bowler is set <br>
on his bullet head <br>
for his boots are wet <br>
and his aunt is dead <br>
<p>
There on the lawn <br>
As the light advances, <br>
On the tide of the dawn, <br>
The cabman dances. <br>
<p>
Swift and strong <br>
as a garden roller <br>
he dances along <br>
in his little bowler <br>
<p>
skimming the lawn <br>
with royal grace <br>
the dew of dawn <br>
on his great red face <br>
<p>
To fairy flutes <br>
as the light advances <br>
in square black boots <br>
the cabman dances <br>

J.B.Morton, otherwise known as <i>Beachcomber</i>, was one of the great <br>
masters of the English nonsense tradition.  His column contains quite <br>
a bit of verse (see also <A HREF="alma.html"><i> Alma Brent </i> </A>)
but most of it is clearly spoof or <br> just high spirits.  There seems
to be a bit more to this one.  It is faintly <br> reminiscent of Edward Lear, not least in the way it resists
dismissal, <br> its obvious absurdity  notwithstanding.  Beachcomber
<i> cognoscenti </i> <br> will recognise a possible allusion to the Huntingdonshire cabmen. <br>
<p>
Morton obviously had views about nonsense verse.  For one thing   <br>  he clearly couldn't stand
A.A. Milne - as the wonderful parody reveals: <br>

<p>
Hush, hush <br>
nobody cares, <br> 
Christoper Robin <br>
has <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fallen <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stairs.<br>
<p>


(Is this an early example of Concrete Poetry?)
<p>
``Hush, hush\\ whisper who dares\\ Christopher Robin\\ is saying his prayers'' <p>Yuck

While i have your ear, a warning... The other day i found a volume of verse by Morton so i bought it&mdash;as one would.
I regretted it as soon as i looked at it. I had always known that Morton was &mdash; how can i put it? &mdash;
<i>ideologically challenged</i>; what this volume of poetry reveals is that when he's not doing the engaging nonsense
bit&mdash;and is instead telling us what he actually thinks&mdash;he's a complete arse. Really.  Trust me. Don't buy it.
