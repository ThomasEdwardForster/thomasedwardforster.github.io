<p>


Gradually we deplete the larder<br>
of all the stock you left us. <br>
Jars are emptied and recycled one by one, <br>
tawdry packets replace them, sometimes we try <br>
a new brand, but slowly <br>
the spaces between them grow.  Even the arrangement  <br>
changes: ideas are always the last thing to go.
<p>

I like the economy of this tidy larder. <br>
I like things to be used and used up and done with. <br>
<p>

What are we to do with your vast untidy love <br>
that fills every room and corner of this house like the sea <br>
in a sinking ship and can never be exhausted? <br>

The poet's wife died suddenly, and he and their child continued <br>
to live in the same house.  This must be what it feels like. <p> (A
footnote to the last three lines: the poet was a sailor.....)
