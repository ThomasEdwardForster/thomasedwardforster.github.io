Immanuel Kant
<hr>

It's a haiku!
<hr>

In the original (Thank you, Julian Fink!) It reads:
<p>

 "Wer den Zweck will, will (so fern die Vernunft
auf seine Handlungen entscheidenden 
Einfluss hat) auch das unentbehrlich notwendige Mittel,
das in seiner Gewalt ist. ''
<p>
As Julian says, this isn't quite right (and I quote him)
<p>

 Note, however, that Kant's remark is not quite correct. As von Wright
 observes, even if you, say, intend to travel to London and a
 necessary means for you to do so is to take the bus, it does not
 follow that you intend to take the bus, even if ``reason has a
 decisive influence" on you. You may, for instance, not believe that
 taking the bus is a necessary means to go to London. Therefore,
 Kant's remark must be adjusted slightly. He should have said "who
 wills the end, wills the means which he <i>believes</i> to be
 indispensably necessary".  (On this point see John Broome's
 ``Instrumental Reasoning", p. 197).
