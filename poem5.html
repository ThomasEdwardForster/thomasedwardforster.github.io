He is afraid of me
<br>
and I of him
<br>
Who might tear each other
<br>
limb from limb
<br>

<br>
Or compel each other
<br>
heart to heart
<br>
never to tear again
<br>
locked limbs apart

  Charles Brasch <hr> Charles Brasch was the founder editor of NZ's
literary magazine, Landfall, and it was with him that NZ literature
started to be a serious operation.  His poetry is unfashionable
nowadays, but it will surely return to favour.  This piece is
uncharacteristically animated: his poetry is normally much more
subdued, with rhyming schemes that are less insistent.

The gender of the speaker is ambiguous, and this is surely
deliberate.  The poet's resolve to protect that ambiguity lends 
the poem&mdash;perhaps inadvertently&mdash;a curious and delightful abstractness
and purity which perfectly sets off its conciseness.  Brasch himself
was gay, as it happens, but it hardly seems to matter.  <br>

The first five lines are obvious; the last three could be done differently.
