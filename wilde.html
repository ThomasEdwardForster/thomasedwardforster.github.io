The scene is Oxford University, where Oscar is a student, and he is a 
candidate for some exam or other.  To pass he has to do a live translation 
of an unseen Greek text.  The text he has been given is some well-known 
passage in the Gospels describing an episode in the final hours of Jesus' 
life.  The arrest?  The meditation in the garden?  I forget. Anyway...<p> 
Oscar recounts the tale in English, fluently translating the Greek original 
as he goes.  And it seems he is doing it very well. <p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
``You may stop now, 
Mr Wilde'' <p> says the examiner... and then again, since Wilde seems to be 
getting carried away <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ``<i> You may stop now, Mr Wilde!</i>'' <p> But
Wilde is not to be denied...<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``But I want to know what <i>happens</i> to
the poor man!''  <hr>


I heard this story from my father, but i don't know where he got it from. 
His father knew Wilde but there is no suggestion that that's how the story 
reaches me.<p> At the risk of spoiling a good anecdote, I venture the suggestion
that this is a very revealing story.  What he is doing with this dissembling 
is suggesting to bystanders that (i) he doesn't know the Bible Story&mdash;thereby 
posing as an atheist cad (posing as a somdomite came later) and that (ii) 
his command of Greek is better than theirs.  It may well be, but the upper-class English have 
always distrusted cleverness.  This is the action of a man bent on making
trouble for himself. And we all know how it ends.<hr>
