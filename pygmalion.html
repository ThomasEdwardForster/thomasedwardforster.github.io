Pygmalion is a totally wonderful play.  I have read it many times over
the years and i would love to act in it. Is it Shaw's best play? It's
certainly his most famous and most successful.  It has a point to make
(Shaw was a political campaigner as well as a playwright) but it also
has a wonderful story and an army of rounded believable characters.
There is not a weak link in it: everything works.







<p>
Eliza is a very attractive and interesting character, and that much is
 obvious to current tastes.  I am not going to add to the body of
 things to be said about her, beyond emphasising that she is not only
 a resourceful and heroic figure, but is <i> also very bright</i>.
 <p>

I once had a colleague who had a desire to play Eliza that was the
 equal of my desire to play Higgins.  I never discovered whether or
 not she could act, but she was beautiful and clever &mdash; and a
 linguist (though not a phonetician) &mdash; and resourceful and (at
 least originally) working-class.  In fact she had once been my
 student, but that had been much earlier. ``That thing?  Sacred, I
 assure you''.  I don't know how good an Eliza she would have made,
 for although she was sociable and outgoing she was not a natural,
 warmhearted, spontaneous creature like Eliza.  Eliza is very lovable.
 But then, in their different ways, all the major characters of
 Pygmalion are lovable.  There are no easy villains and no easy heroes
 ... except possibly Eliza, i s'pose... Every character in the play is
 rounded and entirely believable.  That is one of the great &mdash;
 and usually unremarked &mdash; strengths of this play.  <p> <p> I
 have always wanted to play Higgins.  I carry a particular torch for
 him, because he is too often thought of as a monster.  Higgins is not
 a monster, and the play would be a lesser work if he were. I have
 lots of reasons of course but one of them is that not enough people
 read him properly, and i want him to be properly understood. Quite
 apart from anything else if you misunderstand any of the characters
 you misunderstand the play.  It is easy to represent him as a
 cardboard villain, a bullying monster who is vile to poor Eliza.  I
 want to set the record straight.  Higgins is a <i> teacher</i>
 (probably at UCL, tho' we aren't told.  My father, too, was once a
 language professor at UCL) and this is key to understanding their
 relationship, and key also to understanding <i> him </i>.  <p> OK,
 how does Higgins being an academic show up?  Consider Higgins' line
 in response to Eliza's question ``Why did you do it?''  The stage
 directions require the actor to deliver the reply (``Because it was
 my job'') <b> heartily</b>.  The adverb probably sounds different to
 modern ears from how it sounded in 1912; what Shaw means by
 `heartily' is that this reply of Higgins' comes from the heart: <b>
 he absolutely means it.</b> Perhaps `passionately' would be a better
 modern equivalent.  Higgins is the total professional; teaching Eliza
 <i> is his job</i>. He understands very clearly that The Reason Why
 He Was Put On Earth was precisely to do the things that Eliza is now
 asking of him. And hang the consequences, one might add.  <p> Higgins
 is not a snob.  (Nor is Pickering for that matter).  Higgins tells
 off Eliza for thinking about setting off in a taxi to swank to her
 former associates. It is very striking how Higgins and Pickering
 treat Dolittle as an equal. There is a certain amount of male bonding
 going on in this scene, and a modern director may be able to do
 something with that.  (Dolittle is a totally wonderful creation
 &mdash; a work of genius. There <i> could </i>have been a play
 without him but it's infinitely better </i> with</i> him.  One of the
 members of our troupe in Cambridge was the head porter at Sidney
 Sussex, who wanted to play Dolittle.  It would have been wonderful,
 but we never got round to it).  <br>

Higgins in some sense treats Eliza as an equal, rather in the way he
treats Dolittle. He pops a chocolate into her mouth at one point.  This
could be thought of as a bit of flirting (temperamentally Higgins could
be a flirt, tho' he usually has better things to do) but it's not so much
<i>flirtatiousness</i> as <i>familiarity</i>.  And later of course there
is the exchange where Eliza says that Pickering treats a flower girl the
way he treats a duchess whereas Higgins treats a duchess as a flower girl,
and Higgins says &mdash; yes, the same for everybody.  And of course he's
not defending his boorishness, he's just saying &mdash; that he treats
everyone the same.



<p>
Higgins is also very moral.  He is utterly appalled by the thought that
Dolittle might sell his daughter into prostitution for &pound;50, but
when he is given the true explanation for Dolittle's importunities he
finds them hilarious.  (Higgins actually finds quite a lot of things
hilarious ... this may be a way of coping with a world that he does not
altogether understand but which nevertheless poses no real threat to him:
Higgins has a pretty easy life, all things considerd). He has immense
respect for Eliza (tho' you have to see Higgins as an academic before you
can spot this) so he certainly doesn't think Freddie is good enough for
her; in consequence he is cross with Eliza for (as he sees it) leading
Freddie on, beco's &mdash; although he considers Freddie to be a complete
idiot  &mdash; he doesn't think he should be ill-used on that account.
<p>
He is not only quite moral, but quite specifically entirely <i>
  professional</i>.  He is genuinely black-affronted by any suggestion
that his relationship with Eliza could be anything other than
chaste. (``That thing?  Sacred, i assure you'').  I find myself
puzzled from time to time that anyone could see the play ending with
Higgins and Eliza getting married.  It doesn't make any sense, and if
you think it does then it shows that you haven't understood either the
two characters &mdash; nor the plot &mdash;at all. Shaw knows his
characters well enuff to know it's impossible, and in the Afterword
(see below) he roundly tells off readers who make that mistake.

<p>
  
Hardly anyone seems to grasp the &mdash; to me at least &mdash;
important (and obvious) point that Higgins thinks of himself as a
comedian.  I'm not sure how central this is to the plot but it
certainly helps with a lot of the <i>business</i>. That is not to
say that he is a <i>comic character </i> &mdash; he isn't; he is a
comedian in the sense that he uses banter and joking to improvise his
way out of situations, and this strategy <i> both</i> is conscious
<i> and</i> comes naturally. Of course it can sometimes get him into
trouble, as when he says that Freddy would be useful to the flower-shop
operation co's he'd be the perfect errand-boy.  He's probably also a
good mimic (he's a phonetician after all); when recounting to his mother
in the Tea-Party scene how Mrs Pierce tells him off about Eliza he quotes
her ``you don't think, sir'', and he probably does it in her voice.  His
self-image as a comedian is shown up very clearly in the way he
interacts with Dolittle.  ``You're sure you won't take &pound;10...?''
is a line that Higgins is playing for laughs. (And i do mean <i>
Higgins </i> not <i> Shaw</i> ... by which i mean that it's intended
to make Dolittle and Pickering laugh; the audience can laugh if they
wish.) I can see him doing it with an exaggerated bit of pantomime
with a chequebook, flourishing the quill pen withal ... tho' it seems
from the stage directions that Higgins actually has two fivers to
hand). It's also on show in the way in which he deflects Mrs Pierce's
admonishments about swearing in front of Eliza, and by her half of
that conversation, which makes it clear that she's seen it all
before. He kids everyone along.  Eliza spots it (as i keep saying,
Eliza is <i> sharp</i>) and tells him off. And he <i> accepts </i> his
telling-off.  This is the sense in which he isn't a real bully.  He
accepts it beco's he respects her.  He respects her for &mdash; among
other things &mdash; having had the nerve to approach him in the first
place.  That telling-off tells us a lot about the two characters and
their relationship.  Eliza can see his mind-games, and she is
confident enough in her own judgement to give him a piece of her mind.
But reflect: she is also confident that Higgins will take it on the
chin, and that no harm will come to her from it.  It's another
illustration of the way that Shaw manages to get an enormous amount of
work out of even quite small details.  This is wonderful
stage-writing.

<br>
(I was visiting my lovely colleague Carsten Butz in Copenhagen once, and we had lunch with a friend of his from Heriot-Watt who was also visiting, a woman who had been an administrator in the maths department there.  When i confessed to her that i had always dreamed of doing standup, she said ``Thomas, <i>all</i> academics dream of doing standup.'')
<p> But i digress.  Higgins as a comedian. He is
always alert to the comic possibilities in every situation. The
sequence where Mrs Pearce wonders what to do with Eliza's old clothes
and Higgins says `Burn them!' is a scene that Higgins is playing for
laughs, or &mdash; more specifically &mdash; to <i> get a
reaction</i>. Of course he doesn't think that Eliza's clothes should
be burned but he's not above floating the idea simply to set everybody
a-twitter. And again, I can imagine playing Higgins in the scene with
Mrs Pearce and the butter, brown boots etc with Higgins rolling his
eyes.... certainly at Pickering, possibly even at the audience (tho' i
can imagine the director might have something to say about that). It
would have to be done with great care. <i> Higgins</i> is allowed to
ham it up; the <i> actor playing Higgins</i> absolutely must not.
Somehow these two have to be kept distinct.  I sometimes wish i'd
discussed this with <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Mellor"> Hugh Mellor </A> (we
shared a Pembroke connection and we belonged to the same amateur
dramatic band) and i'm sure he would have had something useful
to say, wearing either his philosopher's hat or his actor's hat. Come
to think of it he would've done an excellent Pickering but it's too
late for that now.  <p>

Higgins doesn't exactly <i> bully</i> people .... he <i>
steamrollers</i> them.... the best word may be the (metaphorical use
of the) french <i> bousculer</i>.  <p> He's hard on Eliza, yes.  He's
hard on everyone of course but he's hard on <i> her</i> specifically,
because she is <i> good</i>.  (At the outset he says to her ``if I
decide to teach you, I'll be worse than two fathers to you'') And she
<i> is</i> good.  Indeed at the start of the Tea Party he and
Pickering positively <i> rave</i> to Mrs. Higgins about how good she
is; they fall over each other to sing her praises.  (Incidentally when Higgins says ``once Pickering starts shouting nobody can get a word in edgeways'' this is obviously a joke made by Higgins (not Shaw) &mdash; the idea that the gentle and mild-mannered Pickering would shout anybody down is  obviously absurd).  Any academic can
tell you that they are hard on their good students &mdash; beco's you
don't want to let them get away with rubbish.  Weak students can be
allowed to write rubbish; strong students must not! If i were playing
Higgins i would want to play the Tea Party scene with Higgins
(silently!)  hanging on her every word like a doting parent, willing
her on.  He's <i> proud</i> of her. She's his star student and this is
her Big Day....  it's the day of her <i> viva voce</i> examination, he
believes in her, and he really really really wants her to do well.
Incidentally having Higgins hanging on her every word is an
improvement on the alternative, which is to have him being bored
shitless by the whole business.  Both serve to make the point of the
following paragraph (Higgins' lack of interest in Society) but hanging
on her every word does that and more.  It would be good theatre too.
<p> Higgins is an intellectual who is not impressed by the niceties
and shibboleths of the bourgeois society in which he is embedded.  In
this he is quite typical of academics (Marx writes somewhere about how
academics aren't proper members of the bourgeoisie) (``My celebrated
son has no manners'' says Mrs Higgins).  Of course the exigencies of
the plot require him to be like this (how else do you arrange for the
professor of phonetics to take on Eliza as a private pupil?) but Shaw
makes a virtue out of a necessity and runs with it.  He tells the
Rockefeller character that the most original moralist in Britain is a
dustman called Alfred Dolittle. Rockefeller asks him a dam' fool
question and gets a dam' fool answer; it's true that he fully deserves
it, but it takes an anarchist like Higgins to dish it out.  Perfect
way to throw a spanner in the works.  Higgins absolutely <i> loves</i>
the idea of sabotaging Society's pretensions by passing off Eliza as a
duchess. He is not impressed by duchesses at all (``We want none of
your Lisson Grove prudery here, young woman; youve got to learn to
behave like a duchess'', tho' one does have the feeling that this is
not just Higgins speaking, but also Shaw through him).  It has to be
admitted that his approach to this project could fairly be described
as irresponsible.  His mother chides him for not thinking about the
consequences.  He is aware that there may <i> be</i> consequences, but
he doesn't think they matter, or if they do, they're someone else's
problem not his.  Why should they matter, anyway?  Society is a load
of nonsense.  Hence his contempt for the Eynsford-Hills .... a
contempt which &mdash; in fairness &mdash; is nevertheless entirely
untinged by malice.  (In fact Higgins is generally entirely without
malice).  That said, it has to be admitted that he eggs on Clara
<p>CLARA: Such nonsense, all this early victorian prudery;<br>
HIGGINS: (<i>tempting her)</i> Such damned nonsense;<br> CLARA: Such
bloody nonsense<p> a <i> bit</i> more than is kind, but Clara has
annoyed him and in any case he thinks Clara too ridiculous to be able
to feel pain.  Not his finest moment one has to admit, but at least
Clara emerges in one piece at the end.  (Come to think of it, <i>
all</i> the characters emerge in one piece at the end.)



<p>

  
Shaw cared (and i think this is part of why i love him so much) about
<i>language</i>, and of all his plays this is the one that best
enables him to indulge his interest in language.  Pygmalion is of
course full of treasures, but one particularly worth making a fuss
about is the tea-party scene. There are all sorts of social points
being made of course, but here Shaw is delighting specifically in
Eliza's language. Higgins is a phonetician, and is interested only in
the sounds that Eliza makes; he has done nothing to work on her
vocabulary and syntax. (She would have been up for it had he made her
&mdash; as i keep saying, Eliza is <i>bright</i>) Shaw has an ear for
Eliza's language in a way that Higgins does not; savour <p> ELIZA:
``Do I not! Them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin,
let alone a hat'' <p> and savour not just the racy and vivid way in
which Eliza naturally speaks but also all those initial `h's that Shaw
has given her to hiss forth.  <i>Of course</i> Shaw has given her a
mouthful of `h's, what with dropping your `h's being such a huge class
marker.

This sensitivity to language is what makes the tea-party scene pure
poetry.  Shaw wrote novels but never, as far as i know, poetry.
Unless it's the Tea-Party.

<hr>


  ELIZA  .... than them slippers.<br>

  HIGGINS <i> Those</i> slippers<br>

ELIZA  Those slippers.  I didn't think it made any difference now
<p>
It is very important that Higgins' response (``<i> those</i>...'')
should be <i> immediate</i>: it's an automatic response. But as soon
as the word <i> those</i> is out he realises that he is putting his
foot in it, that his response is both irrelevant and cruel.  Higgins
is impulsive and irresponsible, yes, but he is not cruel and he is not
obtuse.  This is a situation he cannot banter his way out of, so he
has to beat a quick retreat.  That's why there must be a pause, followed
by `slippers' in <i> sotto voce</i>.  This analysis is borne out by the
fact that to Eliza's riposte ``I didn't think it made any difference
now'' he exhibits a chastened silence.  It doesn't occur to him that
<i>this</i> is the moment to tell her she's a star . . . this is ineptness
rather than cruelty. His skill at banter is not matched by any
appreciation of the <i>beneficial</i> uses to which his dexterity
might be put.  Eliza, too, is silent; she has picked up Higgins' double-take and is hanging
him out to dry.    The stage directions say: <i> A pause. Eliza hopeless
and crushed. Higgins a little uneasy</i>. (As well he might be.)

<p> Some writers have said that the slippers that Eliza throws at
Higgins' head are a reference to Cinderella's.  I think that is a bit
far-fetched.  It's more likely to be a case of what David Lodge calls
``the text working for you'' or what mathematicians call ``the law of
small numbers'' (this is a joke about<A HREF
="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers"> the law of
large numbers</A> and it means that in a confined space you get lots
of coincidences, and they don't mean anything)

This is what Shaw has to say:
<p>

  What Happened Afterwards

<p> 
THE rest of the story need not be shown in action, and indeed, would
hardly need telling if our imaginations were not so enfeebled by their
lazy dependence on the ready-mades and reach-me-downs of the ragshop
in which Romance keeps its stock of "happy endings" to misfit all
stories. Now, the history of Eliza Doolittle, though called a romance
because of the transfiguration it records seems exceedingly
improbable, is common enough. Such transfigurations have been achieved
by hundreds of resolutely ambitious young women since Nell Gwynne set
them the example by playing queens and fascinating kings in the
theatre in which she began by selling oranges.  Nevertheless, people
in all directions have assumed, for no other reason than that she
became the heroine of a romance, that she must have married the hero
of it. This is unbearable, not only because her little drama, if acted
on such a thoughtless assumption, must be spoiled, but because the
true sequel is patent to anyone with a sense of human nature in
general, and of feminine instinct in particular.
<p>
Eliza, in telling Higgins she would not marry him if he asked her, was
not coquetting: she was announcing a well-considered decision. When a
bachelor interests, and dominates, and teaches, and becomes important
to a spinster, as Higgins with Eliza, she always, if she has character
enough to be capable of it, considers very seriously indeed whether
she will play for becoming that bachelor's wife, especially if he is
so little interested in marriage that a determined and devoted woman
might capture him if she set herself resolutely to do it. Her decision
will depend a good deal on whether she is really free to choose; and
that, again, will depend on her age and income. If she is at the end
of her youth, and has no security for her livelihood, she will marry
him because she must marry anybody who will provide for her. But at
Eliza's age a good-looking girl does not feel that pressure: she feels
free to pick and choose. She is therefore guided by her instinct in
the matter. Eliza's instinct tells her not to marry Higgins. It does
not tell her to give him up. It is not in the slightest doubt as to
his remaining one of the strongest personal interests in her life. It
would be very sorely strained if there was another woman likely to
supplant her with him. But as she feels sure of him on that last
point, she has no doubt at all as to her course, and would not have
any, even if the difference of twenty years in age, which seems so
great to youth, did not exist between them.
<p>
As our own instincts are not appealed to by her conclusion, let us see
whether we cannot discover some reason in it. When Higgins excused his
indifference to young women on the ground that they had an
irresistible rival in his mother, he gave the clue to his inveterate
old-bachelordom. The case is uncommon only to the extent that
remarkable mothers are uncommon. If an imaginative boy has a
sufficiently rich mother who has intelligence, personal grace, dignity
of character without harshness, and a cultivated sense of the best art
of her time to enable her to make her house beautiful, she sets a
standard for him against which very few women can struggle, besides
effecting for him a disengagement of his affections, his sense of
beauty, and his idealism from his specifically sexual impulses. This
makes him a standing puzzle to the huge number of uncultivated people
who have been brought up in tasteless homes by commonplace or
disagreeable parents, and to whom, consequently, literature, painting,
sculpture, music, and affectionate personal relations come as modes of
sex if they come at all. The word passion means nothing else to them;
and that Higgins could have a passion for phonetics and idealize his
mother instead of Eliza, would seem to them absurd and
unnatural. Nevertheless, when we look round and see that hardly anyone
is too ugly or disagreeable to find a wife or a husband if he or she
wants one, whilst many old maids and bachelors are above the average
in quality and culture, we cannot help suspecting that the
disentanglement of sex from the associations with which it is so
commonly confused, a disentanglement which persons of genius achieve
by sheer intellectual analysis, is sometimes produced or aided by
parental fascination.
<p>
Now, though Eliza was incapable of thus explaining to herself
Higgins's formidable powers of resistance to the charm that prostrated
Freddy at the first glance, she was instinctively aware that she could
never obtain a complete grip of him, or come between him and his
mother (the first necessity of the married woman). To put it shortly,
she knew that for some mysterious reason he had not the makings of a
married man in him, according to her conception of a husband as one to
whom she would be his nearest and fondest and warmest interest. Even
had there been no mother-rival, she would still have refused to accept
an interest in herself that was secondary to philosophic interests. Had
Mrs. Higgins died, there would still have been Milton and the Universal
Alphabet. Landor's remark that to those who have the greatest power of
loving, love is a secondary affair, would not have recommended Landor to
Eliza. Put that along with her resentment of
Higgins's domineering superiority, and her mistrust of his coaxing
cleverness in getting round her and evading her wrath when he had gone
too far with his impetuous bullying, and you will see that Eliza's
instinct had good grounds for warning her not to marry her Pygmalion.
<p>
And now, whom did Eliza marry? For if Higgins was a predestinate old
bachelor, she was most certainly not a predestinate old maid. Well,
that can be told very shortly to those who have not guessed it from
the indications she has herself given them.
<p>
Almost immediately after Eliza is stung into proclaiming her
considered determination not to marry Higgins, she mentions the fact
that young Mr. Frederick Eynsford Hill is pouring out his love for her
daily through the post. Now Freddy is young, practically twenty years
younger than Higgins: he is a gentleman (or, as Eliza would qualify
him, a toff), and speaks like one; he is nicely dressed, is treated by
the Colonel as an equal, loves her unaffectedly, and is not her master,
nor ever likely to dominate her in spite of his advantage of social
standing. Eliza has no use for the foolish romantic tradition that all
women love to be mastered, if not actually bullied and beaten. ``When
you go to women," says Nietzsche, ``take your whip with
you." Sensible despots have never confined that precaution to women:
they have taken their whips with them when they have dealt with men,
and been slavishly idealized by the men over whom they have flourished
the whip much more than by women. No doubt there are slavish women as
well as slavish men; and women, like men, admire those that are
stronger than themselves. But to admire a strong person and to live
under that strong person's thumb are two different things. The weak
may not be admired and hero-worshipped; but they are by no means
disliked or shunned; and they never seem to have the least difficulty
in marrying people who are too good for them. They may fail in
emergencies; but life is not one long emergency: it is mostly a string
of situations for which no exceptional strength is needed, and with
which even rather weak people can cope if they have a stronger partner
to help them out. Accordingly, it is a truth everywhere in evidence
that strong people, masculine or feminine, not only do not marry
stronger people, but do not shew any preference for them in selecting
their friends. When a lion meets another with a louder roar "the first
lion thinks the last a bore." The man or woman who feels strong enough
for two, seeks for every other quality in a partner than strength.
<p>
The converse is also true. Weak people want to marry
  strong people who do not frighten them too much; and this often
  leads them to make the mistake we describe metaphorically as "biting
  off more than they can chew." They want too much for too little; and
  when the bargain is unreasonable beyond all bearing, the union
  becomes impossible: it ends in the weaker party being either
  discarded or borne as a cross, which is worse. People who are not
  only weak, but silly or obtuse as well, are often in these
  difficulties.  
<p>
This being the state of human affairs, what is
  Eliza fairly sure to do when she is placed between Freddy and
  Higgins? Will she look forward to a lifetime of fetching Higgins's
  slippers or to a lifetime of Freddy fetching hers? There can be no
  doubt about the answer. Unless Freddy is biologically repulsive to
  her, and Higgins biologically attractive to a degree that overwhelms
  all her other instincts, she will, if she marries either of them,
  marry Freddy.  
<p>
And that is just what Eliza did.  
<p>
Complications ensued; but they were economic, not romantic. Freddy had
  no money and no occupation. His mother's jointure, a last relic of
  the opulence of Largelady Park, had enabled her to struggle along in
  Earlscourt with an air of gentility, but not to procure any serious
  secondary education for her children, much less give the boy a
  profession. A clerkship at thirty shillings a week was beneath
  Freddy's dignity, and extremely distasteful to him besides. His
  prospects consisted of a hope that if he kept up appearances
  somebody would do something for him. The something appeared vaguely
  to his imagination as a private secretaryship or a sinecure of some
  sort. To his mother it perhaps appeared as a marriage to some lady
  of means who could not resist her boy's niceness. Fancy her feelings
  when he married a flower girl who had become declass&eacute; under
  extraordinary circumstances which were now notorious!
<p>
  It is true that Eliza's situation did not seem wholly
  ineligible. Her father, though formerly a dustman, and now
  fantastically disclassed, had become extremely popular in the
  smartest society by a social talent which triumphed over every
  prejudice and every disadvantage. Rejected by the middle class,
  which he loathed, he had shot up at once into the highest circles by
  his wit, his dustmanship (which he carried like a banner), and his
  Nietzschean transcendence of good and evil. At intimate ducal
  dinners he sat on the right hand of the Duchess; and in country
  houses he smoked in the pantry and was made much of by the butler
  when he was not feeding in the dining-room and being consulted by
  cabinet ministers. But he found it almost as hard to do all this on
  four thousand a year as Mrs. Eynsford Hill to live in Earlscourt on
  an income so pitiably smaller that I have not the heart to disclose
  its exact figure. He absolutely refused to add the last straw to his
  burden by contributing to Eliza's support.
<p>
  Thus Freddy and Eliza, now Mr. and Mrs. Eynsford Hill, would have
  spent a penniless honeymoon but for a wedding present 500 from the
  Colonel to Eliza. It lasted a long time because Freddy did not know
  how to spend money, never having had any to spend, and Eliza,
  socially trained by a pair of old bachelors, wore her clothes as
  long as they held together and looked pretty, without the least
  regard to their being many months out of fashion. 500 will not last
  two young people for ever; and they both knew, and Eliza felt as
  well, that they must shift for themselves in the end. She could
  quarter herself on Wimpole Street because it had come to be her
  home; but she was quite aware that she ought not to quarter Freddy
  there, and that it would not be good for his character if she did.
<p>
  Not that the Wimpole Street bachelors objected. When she consulted
  them, Higgins declined to be bothered about her housing problem when
  that solution was so simple. Eliza's desire to have Freddy in the
  house with her seemed of no more importance than if she had wanted
  an extra piece of bedroom furniture. Pleas as to Freddy's character,
  and the moral obligation on him to earn his own living, were lost on
  Higgins. He denied that Freddy had any character, and declared that
  if he tried to do any useful work some competent person would have
  the trouble of undoing it: a procedure involving a net loss to the
  community, and great unhappiness to Freddy himself, who was
  obviously intended by Nature for such light work as amusing Eliza,
  which, Higgins declared, was a much more useful and honorable
  occupation than working in the city. When Eliza referred again to
  her project of teaching phonetics, Higgins abated not a jot of his
  violent opposition to it. He said she was not within ten years of
  being qualified to meddle with his pet subject; and as it was
  evident that the Colonel agreed with him, she felt she could not go
  against them in this grave matter, and that she had no right,
  without Higgins's consent, to exploit the knowledge he had given
  her; for his knowledge seemed to her as much his private property as
  his watch: Eliza was no communist. Besides, she was superstitiously
  devoted to them both, more entirely and frankly after her marriage
  than before it.
<p>

It  was the Colonel who finally solved the problem, which had cost him
  much perplexed cogitation. He one day asked Eliza, rather shyly,
  whether she had quite given up her notion of keeping a flower
  shop. She replied that she had thought of it, but had put it out of
  her head, because the Colonel had said, that day at Mrs. Higgins's,
  that it would never do. The Colonel confessed that when he said
  that, he had not quite recovered from the dazzling impression of the
  day before. They broke the matter to Higgins that evening. The sole
  comment vouchsafed by him very nearly led to a serious quarrel with
  Eliza. It was to the effect that she would have in Freddy an ideal
  errand boy.  
<p>
Freddy himself was next sounded on the subject. He said he had been
thinking of a shop himself; though it had presented itself to his
pennilessness as a small place in which Eliza should sell tobacco at
one counter whilst he sold newspapers at the opposite one. But he
agreed that it would be extraordinarily jolly to go early every
morning with Eliza to Covent Garden and buy flowers on the scene of
their first meeting: a sentiment which earned him many kisses from his
wife. He added that he had always been afraid to propose anything of
the sort, because Clara would make an awful row about a step that must
damage her matrimonial chances, and his mother could not be expected
to like it after clinging for so many years to that step of the social
ladder on which retail trade is impossible.
<p>
This difficulty was removed by
  an event highly unexpected by Freddy's mother. Clara, in the course
  of her incursions into those artistic circles which were the highest
  within her reach, discovered that her conversational qualifications
  were expected to include a grounding in the novels of
  Mr. H. G. Wells. She borrowed them in various directions so
  energetically that she swallowed them all within two months. The
  result was a conversion of a kind quite common today. A modern Acts
  of the Apostles would fill fifty whole Bibles if anyone were capable
  of writing it.  
<p>
Poor Clara, who appeared to Higgins and his
  mother as a disagreeable and ridiculous person, and to her own
  mother as in some inexplicable way a social failure, had never seen
  herself in either light; for, though to some extent ridiculed and
  mimicked in West Kensington like everybody else there, she was
  accepted as a rational normal and &mdash; or shall we say inevitable &mdash; sort of
  human being. At worst they called her The Pusher; but to them no
  more than to herself had it ever occurred that she was pushing the
  air, and pushing it in a wrong direction. Still, she was not
  happy. She was growing desperate. Her one asset, the fact that her
  mother was what the Epsom greengrocer called a carriage lady had no
  exchange value, apparently. It had prevented her from getting
  educated, because the only education she could have afforded was
  education with the Earlscourt greengrocer's daughter. It had led her
  to seek the society of her mother's class; and that class simply
  would not have her, because she was much poorer than the
  greengrocer, and, far from being able to afford a maid, could not
  afford even a housemaid, and had to scrape along at home with an
  illiberally treated general servant. Under such circumstances
  nothing could give her an air of being a genuine product of
  Largelady Park. And yet its tradition made her regard a marriage
  with anyone within her reach as an unbearable
  humiliation. Commercial people and professional people in a small
  way were odious to her. She ran after painters and novelists; but
  she did not charm them; and her bold attempts to pick up and
  practise artistic and literary talk irritated them. She was, in
  short, an utter failure, an ignorant, incompetent, pretentious,
  unwelcome, penniless, useless little snob; and though she did not
  admit these disqualifications (for nobody ever faces unpleasant
  truths of this kind until the possibility of a way out dawns on
  them) she felt their effects too keenly to be satisfied with her
  position. Clara had a startling eyeopener when, on being suddenly
  wakened to enthusiasm by a girl of her own age who dazzled her and
  produced in her a gushing desire to take her for a model, and gain
  her friendship, she discovered that this exquisite apparition had
  graduated from the gutter in a few months' time. It shook her so
  violently, that when Mr. H. G. Wells lifted her on the point of his
  puissant pen, and placed her at the angle of view from which the
  life she was leading and the society to which she clung appeared in
  its true relation to real human needs and worthy social structure,
  he effected a conversion and a conviction of sin comparable to the
  most sensational feats of General Booth or Gypsy Smith. Clara's
  snobbery went bang. Life suddenly began to move with her. Without
  knowing how or why, she began to make friends and enemies. Some of
  the acquaintances to whom she had been a tedious or indifferent or
  ridiculous affliction, dropped her: others became cordial. To her
  amazement she found that some "quite nice" people were saturated
  with Wells, and that this accessibility to ideas was the secret of
  their niceness. People she had thought deeply religious, and had
  tried to conciliate on that tack with disastrous results, suddenly
  took an interest in her, and revealed a hostility to conventional
  religion which she had never conceived possible except among the
  most desperate characters. They made her read Galsworthy; and
  Galsworthy exposed the vanity of Largelady Park and finished her. It
  exasperated her to think that the dungeon in which she had
  languished for so many unhappy years had been unlocked all the time,
  and that the impulses she had so carefully struggled with and
  stifled for the sake of keeping well with society, were precisely
  those by which alone she could have come into any sort of sincere
  human contact. In the radiance of these discoveries, and the tumult
  of their reaction, she made a fool of herself as freely and
  conspicuously as when she so rashly adopted Eliza's expletive in
  Mrs. Higgins's drawing-room; for the new-born Wellsian had to find
  her bearings almost as ridiculously as a baby; but nobody hates a
  baby for its ineptitudes, or thinks the worse of it for trying to
  eat the matches; and Clara lost no friends by her follies. They
  laughed at her to her face this time; and she had to defend herself
  and fight it out as best she could. 
<p>
When Freddy paid a visit to Earlscourt (which he never did when he could possibly help it) to
  make the desolating announcement that he and his Eliza were thinking
  of blackening the Largelady scutcheon by opening a shop, he found
  the little household already convulsed by a prior announcement from
  Clara that she also was going to work in an old furniture shop in
  Dover Street, which had been started by a fellow Wellsian. This
  appointment Clara owed, after all, to her old social accomplishment
  of Push. She had made up her mind that, cost what it might, she
  would see Mr. Wells in the flesh; and she had achieved her end at a
  garden party. She had better luck than so rash an enterprise
  deserved. Mr. Wells came up to her expectations. Age had not
  withered him, nor could custom stale his infinite variety in half an
  hour. His pleasant neatness and compactness, his small hands and
  feet, his teeming ready brain, his unaffected accessibility, and a
  certain fine apprehensiveness which stamped him as susceptible from
  his topmost hair to his tipmost toe, proved irresistible. Clara
  talked of nothing else for weeks and weeks afterwards. And as she
  happened to talk to the lady of the furniture shop, and that lady
  also desired above all things to know Mr. Wells and sell pretty
  things to him, she offered Clara a job on the chance of achieving
  that end through her.  
<p>
And so it came about that Eliza's luck held, and the expected
opposition to the flower shop melted away. The shop is in the arcade
of a railway station not very far from the Victoria and Albert Museum;
and if you live in that neighborhood you may go there any day and buy
a buttonhole from Eliza.
<p>
Now here is a last opportunity for romance. Would you not like to be
assured that the shop was an immense success, thanks to Eliza's charms
and her early business experience in Covent Garden?  Alas! the truth
is the truth: the shop did not pay for a long time, simply because
Eliza and her Freddy did not know how to keep it. True, Eliza had not
to begin at the very beginning: she knew the names and prices of the
cheaper flowers; and her elation was unbounded when she found that
Freddy, like all youths educated at cheap, pretentious, and thoroughly
inefficient schools, knew a little Latin. It was very little, but
enough to make him appear to her a Porson or Bentley, and to put him
at his ease with botanical nomenclature. Unfortunately he knew nothing
else; and Eliza, though she could count money up to eighteen shillings
or so, and had acquired a certain familiarity with the language of
Milton from her struggles to qualify herself for winning Higgins's
bet, could not write out a bill without utterly disgracing the
establishment. Freddy's power of stating in Latin that Balbus built a
wall and that Gaul was divided into three parts did not carry with it
the slightest knowledge of accounts or business: Colonel Pickering had
to explain to him what a cheque book and a bank account meant. And the
pair were by no means easily teachable. Freddy backed up Eliza in her
obstinate refusal to believe that they could save money by engaging a
bookkeeper with some knowledge of the business. How, they argued,
could you possibly save money by going to extra expense when you
already could not make both ends meet? But the Colonel, after making
the ends meet over and over again, at last gently insisted; and Eliza,
humbled to the dust by having to beg from him so often, and stung by
the uproarious derision of Higgins, to whom the notion of Freddy
succeeding at anything was a joke that never palled, grasped the fact
that business, like phonetics, has to be learned.
<p>
On the piteous spectacle of the pair spending their evenings in
shorthand schools and polytechnic classes, learning bookkeeping and
typewriting with incipient junior clerks, male and female, from the
elementary schools, let me not dwell. There were even classes at the
London School of Economics, and a humble personal appeal to the
director of that institution to recommend a course bearing on the
flower business. He, being a humorist, explained to them the method of
the celebrated Dickensian essay on Chinese Metaphysics by the
gentleman who read an article on China and an article on Metaphysics
and combined the information. He suggested that they should combine
the London School with Kew Gardens. Eliza, to whom the procedure of
the Dickensian gentleman seemed perfectly correct (as in fact it was)
and not in the least funny (which was only her ignorance) took his
advice with entire gravity. But the effort that cost her the deepest
humiliation was a request to Higgins, whose pet artistic fancy, next
to Milton's verse, was caligraphy, and who himself wrote a most
beautiful Italian hand, that he would teach her to write. He declared
that she was congenitally incapable of forming a single letter worthy
of the least of Milton's words; but she persisted; and again he
suddenly threw himself into the task of teaching her with a
combination of stormy intensity, concentrated patience, and occasional
bursts of interesting disquisition on the beauty and nobility, the
august mission and destiny, of human handwriting. Eliza ended by
acquiring an extremely uncommercial script which was a positive
extension of her personal beauty, and spending three times as much on
stationery as anyone else because certain qualities and shapes of
paper became indispensable to her. She could not even address an
envelope in the usual way because it made the margins all wrong.
<p>
Their commercial school days were a period of disgrace and despair for
the young couple. They seemed to be learning nothing about flower
shops. At last they gave it up as hopeless, and shook the dust of the
shorthand schools, and the polytechnics, and the London School of
Economics from their feet for ever. Besides, the business was in some
mysterious way beginning to take care of itself. They had somehow
forgotten their objections to employing other people. They came to the
conclusion that their own way was the best, and that they had really a
remarkable talent for business. The Colonel, who had been compelled
for some years to keep a sufficient sum on current account at his
bankers to make up their deficits, found that the provision was
unnecessary: the young people were prospering. It is true that there
was not quite fair play between them and their competitors in
trade. Their week-ends in the country cost them nothing, and saved
them the price of their Sunday dinners; for the motor car was the
Colonel's; and he and Higgins paid the hotel bills. Mr. F. Hill,
florist and greengrocer (they soon discovered that there was money in
asparagus; and asparagus led to other vegetables), had an air which
stamped the business as classy; and in private life he was still
Frederick Eynsford Hill, Esquire. Not that there was any swank about
him: nobody but Eliza knew that he had been christened Frederick
Challoner. Eliza herself swanked like anything.
<p>
That is all. That is how it has turned out. It is astonishing how much
Eliza still manages to meddle in the housekeeping at Wimpole Street in
spite of the shop and her own family. And it is notable that though
she never nags her husband, and frankly loves the Colonel as if she
were his favorite daughter, she has never got out of the habit of
nagging Higgins that was established on the fatal night when she won
his bet for him. She snaps his head off on the faintest provocation,
or on none. He no longer dares to tease her by assuming an abysmal
inferiority of Freddy's mind to his own. He storms and bullies and
derides; but she stands up to him so ruthlessly that the Colonel has
to ask her from time to time to be kinder to Higgins; and it is the
only request of his that brings a mulish expression into her face.
Nothing but some emergency or calamity great enough to break down
all likes and dislikes, and throw them both back on their common
humanity &mdash; and may they be spared any such trial! &mdash; will
ever alter this. She knows that Higgins does not need her, just as
her father did not need her. The very scrupulousnesse with which he
told her that day that he had become used to having her there, and
dependent on her for all sorts of little services, and that he
should miss her if she went away (it would never have occurred to
Freddy or the Colonel to say anything of the sort) deepens her inner
certainty that she is ``no more to him than them slippers", yet she has
a sense, too, that his indifference is deeper than the infatuation of
commoner souls. She is immensely interested in him. She has even secret
mischievous moments in which she wishes she could get him alone, on a
desert island, away from all ties and with nobody else in the world to
consider, and just drag him off his pedestal and see him making love
like any common man. We all have private imaginations of that sort.
But when it comes to business, to the life that she really leads as
distinguished from the life of dreams and fancies, she likes Freddy
and she likes the Colonel; and she does not like Higgins and Mr.
Doolittle. Galatea never does quite like Pygmalion: his relation
to her is too godlike to be altogether agreeable.!?
