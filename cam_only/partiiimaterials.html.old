Here are my <A HREF = "logic_supervision_notes.pdf"> supervision
notes</A> for the example sheets. They have an appendix containing
discussions of some tripos questions that people have asked me about
in the past.  The link will be updated so that discussions of
questions on each sheet will go live after all my supervisees have
attempted that sheet. Hoewever for the moment they contain answers to <i>last</i> year's question!<hr> 



Here are some <A HREF = "oldtriposquestions.pdf"> model tripos questions </A> 
that you might find helpful for your revision, and 
<A HREF = "hurkens.pdf"> here </A> is a question more in the style of an 
example sheet question.  These all have model answers which i will show you if 
you submit an answer of your own.
<hr>
I have stumbled upon <A HREF = "exsheet.pdf"> a spiced-up old example sheet for this course</A>.   Some of these questions i have forgotten how to do, so if you tackle them, warn me so i can do my homework!
<hr>
You might find my <A HREF = "TMStalk2012.pdf"> Tutorial on ordinals</A> helpful.
It was a talk to the Trinity Mathematical Society.

The following puzzle came up in my research; you might like to try it.
Fix a set U, and suppose we have a family X of n distinct subsets of
U.  Show that we can find a family x of at most n-1 members of U, such 
that, for any two distinct members of X, there is a member of x that belongs to one but not the other.

An answer to <A HREF = "cleverblass.pdf">  Hyland sheet 2 q 9 (2007/8 edition)</A>. 
It is a proof that for any vector space all its bases are the same size. 
It uses the prime ideal theorem. I think it comes from Rubin and Rubin but it was shown me by Andreas Blass.

Here is a discussion of  <A HREF = "rickard.pdf"> Question 14 </A> on Prof Leader's 
first example sheet from 2011.<br>
Here is a discussion of  <A HREF = "peto.pdf"> Question 14 </A> on Prof Leader's 
second example sheet from 2011.
<hr>

 <A HREF = "choice.pdf">Here</A> is the material on 
Question 6 on sheet 4 of Professor Johnstone's 2012 Set Theory and Logic alluded to in my <A HREF = "logic_supervision_notes.pdf"> supervision
notes</A>.

<hr> 
<A HREF = "axinfnonce.pdf"> Here </A> is
a brief discussion of the subtleties of deducing the axiom of the
empty set from the axiom of infinity.  <br>
You might like to have a look at my notes (to be published
one day, eventually! by CUP) on <A HREF = "axiomsofsettheory.pdf"> the
axioms of set theory</A>.

<br>
These <A HREF ="fundamentalsequence.pdf"> notes on countable ordinals </A>might be useful.
<br>
I include here a shameless plug for <A HREF = "baby.html"> Logic
Induction and sets </A>, the most wonderful introduction to --- well
--- <i> Logic induction and sets </i> that the world has ever seen.
I'm not suggesting for even one moment that you should <i> read </i>
it: just <i> buy </i> it!  <hr>  <hr>
