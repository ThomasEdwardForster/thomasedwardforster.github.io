Brahms 
<br> had two arms;
<br>Spohr
<br>had four,
<br> while Beethoven
<br> had eight of them.

I'd always felt that there should be a clerihew that rhymed `Brahms'
with `arms'. Eventually my then brother-in-law Jeremy Walker supplied one&mdash;in the form of the first four lines above. This spurred me to produce
the final extra couplet.  Purists will no doubt be appalled by this
horrible mutant, but I plead that the extra lines are in the nonsense 
spirit in which clerihews should always be written.  Anyway,
if they have extra arms why shouldn't it have extra lines?  Answer me
that! Naturally suggestions for further improvement are welcome, but
the number of any subsequent complement of arms must <i> of course
</i> be a power of two. (If you need to ask why you shouldn't be
reading this page).<p>

(Recently I acquired a copy of `More Biography' By E.C.Bentley, which&mdash;it 
turns out&mdash;contains a clerihew that rhymes `Brahms' with `arms'.  It goes 
without saying that the text above is infinitely superior to the puny 
offering of Edmund Clerihew. B.)

(How about... 
<p>
Borodin<br>
had sixteen;<br>
and Martinu;<br>
had thirty-two<br>..??)<p>

Gregory Sankaran has just reminded me that he had contributed

<p>
Et Dutilleux<br>
en a eu trente-deux.
