<strong>
NF 76 in Cambridge
</b></strong>  <p>

We meet in the Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Wilberforce road,
Cambridge, from the 28th March until the 3rd April.<hr> The meetings
will be in MR 15 on the 28th to the 31st March; then in MR 11 on the
1st and 2nd of April, and in MR 2 on the 3rd of April.<hr> We will
supply food, which will be  paid for by the
funding that the conference has received through the good will and
generosity of the Wes and Margaret fund.
 <p> The timetable is flexible.  Since the purpose of the meeting is
to acquaint the research community with Randall's proof, we will meet
10-12 and 2-4 every day to hear an exposition from him.  I am also
hoping to persuade Adam Epstein to give us a series of tutorials on
non-concretisability results in geometry.  As yet we do not have a
timetable for these talks. Other participants might have news that
they want to bring us, so i expect there may be a number of fringe
events.<hr>
