Johann Peter Hebel

(I'm not entirely sure about the orthography: Allemannisch orthography
has changed a bit since Hebel's day, and in any case Hebel's dialect
is slightly different from the dialect of the City of Basel that I am
used to and in which i tend to remember this poem.  [Baseld&uuml;tsch
would have `kunnt' not `chunnt' and generally `k' for the chi sound 
<i> passim</i>].  I put two dots over several `e's that follow `u's 
(for example in `suech' in the first verse) to make clear that it's 
a diphthong not a fronted pure `u'.   This is not standard allemannisch orthography! 
To a certain extent this is from memory so i may have 
got the text wrong as well!).   <p>
Actually my friend Roger Paulin (a later holder of the Chair in German at Cambridge that my father held) has recently given me a copy of the Penguin Book of German verse (edited by my father) which must be where i first encountered this poem. I shall correct the spelling when i get round to it.

Translation follows:
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; We have just buried a man.  It was a shame about his gifts: go where you will, you shall not see his like again.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; He knew all about the skies.  Up and down all the villages he would say "Has anyone seen any sign of a <i>star"</i>?<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a brave knight too.   Up and down all the villages he would say "Has anyone seen any sign of a <i>Bear</i> or a <i>Lion</i>?"<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; And a good Christian.  Up and down all the villages he could be seen making his daily and nightly pilgrimage to the <i>Cross</i>.<br>


&nbsp; &nbsp; He was well connected with the gentry, both in town and country.  <i>The Three Kings</i> were his favourite company.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Now he's dead and oblivious to all that.  One day we will all be like him.

The Drei K&ouml;nig was still there a century later when I used to
visit Basel in my youth and it is probably still there now: no mere
pub but a large hotel&mdash;on the left bank overlooking the river just
downstream of the M&uuml;nsterberg. For some reason the name
emblazoned on it is in French: <i>Hotel des trois Rois</i>.  Perhaps
it was an important hostelry in Hebel's day too.  After all, the
poem's hero was well-connected with the gentry.  I have recently
discovered that it was the first port of call for Liszt and Marie
d'Agoult when they eloped.  Clearly a place to be seen&mdash;or perhaps
<i> not</i> seen!

 <p> 

I have always thought of Hebel as a kind of Swiss Chaucer.
In <i> English Social History</i> G.M. Trevelyan described Chaucer as the first artist in whom we
recognize the english temper "Three parts cynical and one part
kindly".  Like Chaucer, Hebel sees humanity's faults clearly but does
not judge us too harshly.  And&mdash;again like Chaucer&mdash;he is wonderfully funny. Have a look at
