Because the majority of me
<br>rejects the majority of you
<br>debating ends forthwith and we
<br>divide and&mdash;sure of what to do&mdash;
<br>we disinfect whole blocks of days
<br>for our majorities to rent 
<br>with unshared friends and unwalked ways.
<br>But silence too is eloquent, 
<br>a silence of minorities 
<br>that&mdash;unopposed at last&mdash;return 
<br>each night with cancelled promises 
<br>they want renewed:  they never learn.

Philip Larkin

I know this is the third Larkin in the collection but i'm a normal
person really. Honest.  My excuse for this one is that my friend
Charlotte Paul gave me a copy of the Collected Larkin and when i
picked it up it fell open at this page: the poem was so perfectly
constructed that i had it by heart after reading it just once.  And i
have just written it out from memory too...
