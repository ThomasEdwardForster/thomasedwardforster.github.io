Joseph Needham <br>
dances with philosophic freedom.<br>
You have to mind your toes if<br>
You go dancing with Joseph. <br>


<hr> Anon <hr> Joseph Needham was a western scholar famous for his
study of Chinese Science, and apparently in his youth was a morris
dancer. I don't know where this verse comes from.  I heard it from my
father and it is presumably part of the Cambridge oral tradition.  I
have found no sources for it on the internet.
