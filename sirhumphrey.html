[Bernard] listened for a moment, then replaced the receiver.<br>
``He's coming round now''<br>``Why?" I was feeling malicious ``Did he faint?"<br>

We looked at each other in silence. And we both tried very hard not to laugh

``The identity of this official whose alleged responsibility for this
hypothetical oversight has been the subject of recent speculation is
not shrouded in such impenetrable obscurity as certain previous
disclosures may have led you to assume, and, in fact, not to put too
fine a point on it, the individual in question was, it may surprise
you to learn, the one whom your present interlocutor is in the
habit of defining by means of the perpendicular pronoun''

I first saw this in Wellington, with my friend Anne Budd, a professional
actress.  When Hacker said ``Why, did he faint?'' Anne's professional eye
spotted something. ``That was an <i>ad lib.</i>" she exclaimed ``Look, 
they've corpsed''.  I looked, and they had. Years later i found the complete 
scripts in an op shop, and yes, the <i>ad lib.</i> was by then incorporated 
into the official text; the people making this programme knew a good thing 
when they saw one.   I've never seen the <i>urtext</i>, but i'd bet good 
money that Anne was right.  It's a pleasure to see professionals at work.

I love Humphrey's speech, and i bet Nigel Hawthorne did too. Ludicrous
(tho' perhaps <i>Gilbertian</i> is a better word) tho' it is, it's a
speech worthy of a tragic hero, and Sir Humphrey (yes, really) is a
tragic hero.  Hawthorne probably had no difficulty memorising it: it's
a treat.  The perpendicular pronoun indeed.  Humphrey had a first in
Greats from The Other Place, didn't he...?  

<p> 
But perhaps the best thing about this little scene &mdash; which is
probably the reason why the programme-makers allowed the <i>ad
lib.</i> to stand &mdash; is that of course it's not just Paul Eddington and
Derek Fowles who corpse, it's also Hacker and Bernard.  If it were
just Eddington and Fowles then the take would have been snipped and we
would only have seen it &mdash; if at all &mdash; on one of those ghastly
programmes about film out-takes.  <br>
Notice that it's not supposed to make the <i>audience</i> crack up.  <i>The Importance of Being Sir Humphrey</i>  is Gilbertian comedy, <i>not</i> farce, and it has to be played <b>absolutely 
straight.</b> <hr>
