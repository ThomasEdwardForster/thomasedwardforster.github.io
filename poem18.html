<br>

Tiger, tiger, burning bright
<br>
In the forests of the night
<br>
What immortal hand or eye 
<br>
could frame thy fearful symmetry?
<br>

<br>
In what distant deeps or skies
<br>
burnt the fire of thine eyes?
<br>
On what wings dare he aspire
<br>
What the hand dare seize the fire?
<br>

<br>
And what shoulder and what art
<br>
could twist the sinews of thy heart?
<br>
And when that heart began to beat
<br>
what dread hand? and what dread feet?
<br>

<br>
When the stars threw down their spears 
<br>
and watered heavan with their tears
<br>
Did he smile his work to see?
<br>
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
<br>

<br>
Tiger, tiger, burning bright
<br>
In the forests of the night
<br>
What immortal hand or eye 
<br>
dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
<br>

  William Blake <hr> Not much to say about this poem, is there,
really?  It's the companion piece (in the Songs of Experience) to the
Lamb (in the Songs of Innocence) so it's clear that the Tyger was Not
A Good Thing.  The fact that Blake obviously didn't know what a tiger
looked like (see the wonderful watercolour&mdash;where the purported tiger
is obviously a creature from a nightmare) doesn't really seem to
matter. Nor does it matter that we don't know what it means: what
matters is that it is <i>ecstatic,</i> and it <i>possesses</i> us.  In this 
poem we see&mdash;uncensored&mdash;the full violence of Blake's poetic vision, 
and the delight we experience in it is almost voyeuristic. <p>
In the first volume of his autobiography Bertrand Russell recalls being
stopped dead in his tracks while trying to descend a staircase in
Trinity (Cambridge) by his friend Crompton reciting the Tyger.  He
wrote <p> "I had never, till that moment, heard of Blake and the poem
affected me so much that I became dizzy and had to lean against the
wall". <p>And that was the man who wrote half of <i>Principia
Mathematica</i>! Don't let anyone tell you that mathematicians are all
cold fish. <p>

One fact about this poem that has always struck me is that no-one ever
seems to have made any attempt to set it to music.  Scriabin would
have tried had he known of it, but fortunately he didn't.  (Blake 
generally doesn't go well to music.  Just imagine the kind of mess 
one could make if one tried to set <i>Jerusalem</i> to music... it 
doesn't bear thinking of).   Of course it's obviously impossible, but for 
all that one might derive some benefit from asking what it is about 
this poem that makes it so obviously impossible.  I am forever telling
my students that sometimes explanations of the obvious can be illuminating.
(For example: I, for one, would love to gain some insight into why the
Parrot Sketch is the best-loved comedy sketch (<i>is it</i> a comedy sketch..?)
of all time.)<p>

I have recently learnt that 
<A HREF ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bolcom">William Bolcom</A> 
set the whole of <i> The Songs of Innocence and Experience</i> to music.  
I haven't heard it, and i'm not planning to.  Not for the obvious reason, 
but beco's the only work of Bolcom's i know is the utterly delightful 
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jftAt4mXFk"> The Graceful Ghost</A> rag and i don't want the disappointment of learning that that was his best work.
