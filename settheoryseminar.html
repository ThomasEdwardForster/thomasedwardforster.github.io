</HTML> </h2> We meet in Meeting Room 12 at 14:00 on wednesdays in
full term.  I will not return from New Zealand until the 21st october
so the first few meetings will presumably be organised by Vu Dang or
Zachiri McKenzie.<hr> The only speaker arranged so far for Michaelmas
2008 is Prof Hyland, who will talk about FM models and countably
categorical theories.  This will be some time in november, the exact
date to be announced later.  <hr> There may end up being a theme to
these meetings.  I am a great believer in the practice of meeting
every week whatever happens so that people get used to the idea that
that time means that activity - <i> homo sapiens </i> is a creature of
habit after all - so it may be that we will sustain a background
activity of getting through the Bagaria notes: <A HREF
