I am now back from New Zealand, where I  spent the
northern summer estivating in the University of Canterbury at
Christchurch as an Erskine Fellow. I am currently lecturing the
Introductory Logic course for the CS M.Phil. and the Logic for 
Linguists course (both at Cambridge).

<a name="research"><strong></strong></a><strong><hr><FONT SIZE="+2">Research</FONT></TD>:</strong> </p>
I work on Set Theory, Type Theory, BQO theory, Philosophy of Mathematics and Philosophy of Mind.  I developed
this last interest when I was a music+philosophy student and it led me
into  <A HREF ="tfEEG.jpg">
Neurophysiology </A>
: until relatively recently I was a paid-up member of the <A
HREF = "http://ansuk.org/"> Electro-Physiological
Technologists Association</A>.  I had to give up
my part-time post at Addenbrooke's doing EEGs to take up my Pittsburgh
Fellowship
<A HREF = "eeg.html">,</A>  but I am always interested in EEG locum work.  The
combination of an interest in Philosophy of Mind and a training in
logic has given me an abiding interest in the logic of virtual
(theoretical) entities. (Having the part of the Cheshire Cat in the
school production of Alice about the time the above photograph was
taken probably played a part too). Indeed when the <A HREF =
"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/SS:DP::DEPTLOGIC,AD,HOMEP,LPS"> Logic and
Philosophy of Science department at the University of California at
Irvine </A> were so kind as to invite me to spend three months with
them I took the opportunity to write a book about it, called <A HREF =
"baby2.html">Reasoning about Theoretical Entities</A>.  Not
surprisingly, given my exposure to the Life Sciences and my interest
in reasoning about theoretical entities, I have an interest in
Philosophy of Biology.  Perhaps I'll get round to giving a course on
it one day.  Most of my publications concern Quine's set theory <A
HREF = "http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/nf.html"> NF</A>,
for which an introduction for a general audience can be found <A HREF =
"AMM.ps"> here</A> (it was a 60th anniversary retrospective article
for the American Mathematical Monthly).<hr>

<a name="ancestry"><strong></strong></a><strong><FONT SIZE="+2">Ancestry</FONT></TD></strong> 
  <br> My mother came from <A HREF =
"http://www.basel.ch/de/basel/home"> Basel</A>, the city that produced
Leonhard Euler and Holbein and has been home to the Bernoulli family
since they were expelled by the Reyes Catolicos (isn't that enough for
a small town???).  We know about the mathematicians of course, (and
even the tennis players: Roger Federer is a Basler) but it has also
produced some wonderful painters - and not just Holbein. Sadly the
creator of this little <A HREF = "/~tf/pipe.jpg">gem</A> in the
Eulerstrasse (yes, it's the same Euler) did not sign his work and his
(her?) identity was not recorded for posterity.  I tell everyone I am
a fourth-generation academic, and this is because of her (my mother's) 
grandfather who was a fairly well-known chemist (he discovered the 
rearrangement of allyl thiocyanate to allyl <i>iso</i>thiocyanate) 
from whom i inherited through her not only some genes for doing 
chemistry but also a  <A HREF="billeter.html"> dressing-gown</A>.
The only other ancestor I know of who is sufficiently well-known 
to have his own wikipedia entry is 
<A HREF ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Freke">John Freke</A>, but 
I get only about 0.4% of my genes from him - which is a pity, 'cos he was an FRS!


<p>
But in any case it's intellectual ancestry one worries about. 

I had two DoktorVater: Adrian Mathias in Cambridge, and 
<A HREF = "mauricepiccie.ps"> Maurice Boffa</A>  
in Brussels. Sadly, Boffa died in 2001: it is a terrible loss.   
<A HREF = "sarahf.html"> Here</A> are two group pictures, with three of his
Ph.D. students. 
My
other DoktorVater, <A HREF = "http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/">
Adrian Mathias</A>, is still very much alive - for the moment at
least: he does live uncomfortably near an active volcano!)  
According to the <A HREF = "http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=77585">
Mathematics Genealogy Project </A> I am descended (thru' Mathias) 
from Fichte, Hegel, Kant and Leibniz!!



<p> Like
Everyone Who Is Anyone in Silicon Fen I worked (briefly) for Clive Sinclair,  in my case in 
the <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Radionics">
Sinclair Radionics</A> days.  (He was a neighbour of my parents).  My
Erd&ouml;s 
number is 3: Forster-Truss-Shelah-Erd&ouml;s ; (and Erd&ouml;s  many years
ago described me as ``a very strange young man''!). But there are
other metrics. My Trotsky number is 3 (I shared an office with a  colleague <A
HREF = "http://www.cs.unibo.it/~corsi/">
(Giovanna Corsi)</A> who shared an office with a  colleague <A HREF =
"http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/heijen/"> 
(Jean van Heijenoort)</A> who was Trotsky's bodyguard); my Beethoven
number is 4, since I have shaken hands with a man who shook hands with
a man who shook hands with Grillparzer, who shook hands with
Beethoven, Liszt...well - everyone!  I once played Garcia Lorca's
piano. I used to play chess with a woman who had been Tolstoy's
next-door neighbour, and had been taught by <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Alekhine">Alekhine</A>
. When an infant
she had been dandled on Tchaikovsky's knee. If you are a Canadian you
may be impressed by the fact that I once had my portrait painted by <A
HREF ="barker.jpg"> Barker Fairley</A> (he's the one with the pipe in
this group picture of the group of seven); apparently I am the only
person other than Wittgenstein to have given a course of lectures in
Cambridge gazetted under the title `Philosophy'; my Ph.D. Thesis  
 title <A HREF ="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/223940"> "N.F." <A/>
is the shortest on record; as far as I know I am the only
person to have a Cambridge Ph.D. in mathematics without having done
any undergraduate mathematics; finally I must surely be the only Logic
Ph.D. anywhere in the world who is also licenced to drive an EEG
machine. My remaining distinguishing features are of less
interest. Born in the oldest house in Cambridge? And a haunted one at
that? (It's the <A HREF ="http://www.zurichmansion.org/abbeys/abbey.html"> Abbey House</A>. It
had been a gift from Lord Fairhaven to the Cambridge City Council who then
divided it into flats and let them out - so should I ever want to go
into politics I can always say I was born in council house! and I was
delivered by <A HREF = "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-dr-alice-roughton-1588899.html"> Alice
Roughton</A>). The only person to have been at school with both the
erstwhile Home Secretary (Charles Clarke) and the Queen's (erstwhile) 
private secretary (Robin Janvrin)?  (Not to mention the - sadly - 
thoroughly unmemorable  <A HREF ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake"> 
Nick Drake  </A> who was in my Russian class at Marlborough).  The 
tabloids are not beating a path to my door. I do not - yet - have a 
theorem named after me, (nor even an
airport, see above) tho' there is a lifeform bearing my name: not a 
child - sadly- but a <i>midge</i>
called <A HREF = "/~tf/midge.html"> Telnatogeton Forsteri</A>.  This
lives only in New Zealand - there is a type specimen in my desk drawer in
Cambridge but it's definitely dead. This lifeform was discovered by my
friend <A HREF =
"http://osms.otago.ac.nz/physiology/staff/leader.html"> John Leader</A>.  If you wish to name an invertebrate or a theorem - or even an airport -
after me, feel free.
