<p>

It is a thought breaking the granite heart
<br>
Time has given me, that my one treasure
<br>
Your limbs, those passion-vines, your bamboo body
<p>
Should age and slacken, rot
<br>
Some day in a ghastly clay-stopped hole.
<br>
They led me to the mountains beyond pleasure
<p>

Where each is not gross body or blank soul
<br>
But a strong harp the wind of genesis
<br>
Makes music in.  Such resonant music
<p>

That I was Adam, loosed by your kiss
<br>
From time's hard bond, and you
<br>
My love, in the world's first summer stood


<p>

Plucking the flowers of the abyss.

  James K. Baxter <hr> This is Baxter again.  I came to know it because
<A HREF ="poem5.html"> Charles Brasch </A> told me that this was Baxter's best poem.  It may well be:
Brasch was a shrewd critic; certainly much better than Baxter, who was
a hopeless critic of his own work: he actually tho'rt his best poem
was <i>Henley Pub</i>. (Don't ask).  Too successful too young.  Wish I had
that problem.
