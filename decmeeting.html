 <p> There will be a series of Logic-related events in Cambridge
starting on Wednesday 29th November and running into the weekend.
Entirely by coincidence there are a lot of <A HREF = "http://www.claymath.org/annual_meeting/claylecture.php"> Clay
lectures </A> in Cambridge that same week.
<p>

The Logic-related events include:

A Cameleon meeting on Saturday 2/xii.  It will be held in Meeting Room 2 in the Centre for Mathematical Sciences.

<br>  Speakers so far:
<hr>

Philip Ehrlich
<p>
<A HREF = "ehrlichCameleon.pdf">
The Absolute Arithmetic Continuum and The Unification of All Numbers Great and Small </A>

<p> <hr>

                Harold Simmons   (University of Manchester)
<p>
   The topological content of Monotone Bar Induction and the Fan   Principle
<p>
Abstract:
<p>

   Both MBI and FP are techniques used in some variant of constructive
mathematics. They also have some interest for proper mathematics. They
are often only applied only to the Baire tree and the Cantor tree,
respectively, but in a suitable form can be applied to any tree. In
the classical context they are choice principles related to Dependent
Choice. The two principles are not equivalent and the difference can
be measure using a tological ranking technique.
<br>
   I will describe some of the older work on the techniques, and then
   throw in a new observation.
<p><hr>

Carsten Butz   (ITU, Copenhagen)
<p>


<A HREF = "BVM-revisited-CambridgeNov2006.pdf"> Boolean valued Models revisited </A> 
<p> <hr>

Jamie Gabbay
<p>
<A HREF = "gabbay.html">  Substitution in Fraenkel-Mostowski sets </A>


<p> <hr> Details of other talks will be posted here in due course.
The provisional timetable is: Ehrlich 1100, Simmons 1230, Butz 1445,
Gabbay 1615, but this can changed if any participants feel strongly.


<hr>
Cameleon traditionally provides food and drink to participants: 
if you want to come to the meeting tell tf@dpmms.cam.ac.uk so
we can calculate how many loaves and fishes to buy.

A Minicourse on countable ordinals.  This will be in the Computer
Laboratory's Minicourse Series, and will take the form of three
two-hour sessions (10.00 to noon) on each of the three days Wednesday
29/xi, Thursday 30/xi and Friday 1/xii. The friday session will be
0900-1045 in order not to clash with the Part IV lecture (see below).
The sessions will be in FW11 in the Computer Laboratory.  The first
talk will be given by Thomas Forster and the second and third by
Harold Simmons.  For details follow the links in <A HREF =
"http://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/6226"> Cambridge Talks </A>


<hr><hr> A CUSPOMMS (Cambridge University Society for the Philosophy
of Mathematics and the Mathematical Sciences) meeting <p> Speaker:
Stewart Shapiro: <A HREF = "shapiroabst.txt"> "The open-texture of
computability" </A> (The paper is an attempt to apply Waismann's
notion of open-texture, and Lakatos's *Proofs and refutations*, to the
notion of computability, and thus to the question of whether Church's
thesis is subject to mathematical proof.) There is a handout
<A HREF = "Shapiro-Church-Lakatoshandout.pdf"> here  </A>.

<br> It will be held on
Friday 1/xii in the Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Meeting Room 3,
at the usual time of 1400hrs.

  <hr> <hr> <p> At 1100-1300 on Friday 1/xii Meeting Room 14, CMS,
there will be a ``Part IV'' lecture on Quine's set theory <i>NF</i> by
Thomas Forster.  This is part of DPMMS's programme of lectures for
graduates.  This lecture will be devoted to background in NF, since I
now have a Ph.D. student studying it.

My assistant during these vexed times will be Dang VU: whose mobile number

CAMELEON (CAMbridgE LEeds Or Norwich) exists to further links
between logicians at the three universities its name alludes to.  It has funding from
<A HREF ="http://www.lms.ac.uk/"> The
London Mathematical Society </A> and <A HREF
="http://www.stlukesinstitute.org.uk"> The St Luke's Institute.  </A>
