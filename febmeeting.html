CAMELEON (CAMbridgE LEeds Or Norwich) exists to further links
between logicians at the three universities its name alludes to.  It has funding from
<A HREF ="http://www.lms.ac.uk/"> The
London Mathematical Society </A> and <A HREF
="http://www.stlukesinstitute.org.uk"> The St Luke's Institute.  </A>
 <p><hr>
 <p> The next meeting is on tuesday 8th march.  Venue: Centre for
Mathematical Sciences, Wilberforce Road, Cambridge.  We have booked 
Meeting Room 10 from 0900 to 1300 and Meeting Room 4 from 1300 to 1730.  
After that there will be drinks and nibbles in a venue yet to be
determined.


 <p> 

We have four speakers.  Aspero is the first speaker by special request, at 1200 in MR 10, the Mary Godfrey Room on the first floor of Pavilion B; the other talks are not yet timetabled, but my guess is that subsequent talks will be at  1315, 1430, 1545 and 1700, tho' this is not yet set in stone

Forcing simply definable well-orders of the reals
 <p>
ZFC, the usual system of axioms of set theory, with the Axiom of 
Choice, certainly implies that there is a well-order of the reals. 
However it is not difficult to see that it does not imply the 
existence of such a definable well-order. 
A consequence of results of Woodin is that, in the presense of 
sufficiently strong large cardinals, there cannot be any well-order of 
the reals that admits a ZFC-provably antisymmetric definition over $H
(\omega_2)$ of complexity $\Sigma_2$ or $\Pi_2$ (without parameters). 
In this talk I will look at the possibility of forcing a well-order of 
the reals that admits ZFC-provably antisymmetric $\Sigma_3$ and $\Pi_3
$ definitions over $H(\omega_2)$ without parameters. In view of the 
above mentioned limitations this is then the optimal result from the 
point of view of the Levy hierarchy of formulas (if sufficiently 
strong large cardinals exist). Our starting hypothesis will be the 
existence of an inaccessible limit of measurable cardinals and the 
construction will use a technique for manipulating the guessing or non-
guessing of all canonical functions for ordinals in $\omega_2$ by a 
single function $H$ defined on a stationary subset of $\omega_1$ such 
that, for all $\nu\in dom(H)$, $H(\nu)$ is a subset of $\omega_1$ of 
suitably bounded order type. The existence or nonexistence of such 
functions $H$ defines a possibly new family of combinatorial 
properties for subsets of $\omega_1$.

Cuts and gluts


 <A HREF = "http://www.lofs.ucl.ac.be/log/perso/Crabbe/textes/cutsgluts.pdf"> THE ABSTRACT</A> <p> We define validity with respect to models allowing
gluts and connect this with the proof-theoretical phenomenon of
cut-absorption, by defining a notion of glut-derivation and showing
that a sentence is valid in the new sense iff it is glut-derivable.
This part includes a systematisation of well known results by Schutte
and Girard.  We end by providing an example of a set-theoretic system
enjoying cut elimination without extensionality, but not when an
extensionality rule is present.

Open colourings and cardinal invariants.
 <p> 
Abstract:  
 <p> 
We show that the Open Colouring Axiom introduced by
Abraham, Rubin and Shelah (OCA_[ARS])
implies that most of the classical
cardinal invariants of the continuum, i.e., the ones in
Cichon's diagram, are big.
We will also mention a dual of OCA_[ARS].

Scott-style models for positive abstraction
 <p> 
Abstract
 <p> 


The subject of this talk is positive abstraction in set theory. By
"abstraction" (instead of comprehension), it is understood that the language
is equipped with an abstractor "{-|-}" which allows the formation of set
abstracts as primitive terms; and by "positive" it is meant that the use of
the abstractor is restricted to negation-free formulas in that extended
language. As for the untyped lambda calculus, the consistency of positive
abstraction with extensionality can be proved by a term model construction
or by means of Scott-style models. We shall focus on these latter here to
present some unexpected consequences of the use of an abstractor in
(positive) set theory.

If you want to come to the meeting tell tf@dpmms.cam.ac.uk so
we can get a good fix on numbers.  There will be a supper after the
meeting.  Definitely tell
tf if you wish to stay for this!
