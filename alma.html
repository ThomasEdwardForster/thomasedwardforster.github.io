<p>
I knew a girl called Alma Brent<br>
Completely destitute of brains<br>
Whose principal accomplishment<br>
Was imitating railway trains.
<p>
When ladies called at "Sunnyside''<br>
Mama, to keep the party clean,<br>
Would say, with pardonable pride<br>
"Now, Alma, do the six-fifteen!"
<p>
The child would grunt and snort and puff<br>
With weird contortions of the face<br>
And when the guests had had enough<br>
She'd cease, with one last wild grimace.
<p>
One day, her jovial Uncle Paul<br>
Cried "Come on, Alma, do your worst!''<br>
And challenged thus before them all<br>
She did the four-nineteen&mdash;and burst.

Beachcomber <hr> I take this to be a Belloc parody, tho' that's
guesswork on my part.  (Wouldn't one expect Beachcomber to be a Belloc fan,
both being Francophiles, C*****ic, and both right-wing..?)  <br> I was
disconcerted by not having this thing by heart. (I can normally
memorise this kind of doggerel at the drop of a hat, which leads me to
suspect that there is some infelicity blighting it that my critical
faculties are not up to spotting).  [Surely `grimace' does not rhyme
with `face'..]  As it is, i am endebted instead to Ann Turrell who
supplied me the source. o/w i'd've had to go to storage to find the
box containing all my Beachcomber volumes.  Thank you Ann!!  <hr>
