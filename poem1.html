<p>


Some poems have no plan <br>
you just have to be there to catch <br>
the express when it whooshes through <br>
and there's no timetable. <br>

<p>

Oh they're not at all <br>
like embroidery laid aside <br>
taut in its drumlike frame
 <br>
and awaiting a meditative hour
 <p>
Chance is all against them
 <br>
they are as unlikely as this love&mdash;
<br>
who knows when we'll meet again?
 <br>
And it's not that we don't want to&mdash;

<p>
but then the children, the grave demands 
 <br>
of time and place, our health even&mdash;
 <br>
the years compacting round our roots
 <br>
perhaps it'll always be like this?
<p>

Oh no, we say, we simply can't!
 <br>
seeing it all so clearly:
 <br>
and yet we're left breathless 
 <br>
standing here at the dusty crossing
 <br> <br>
while the red light bobs away
 <br>
and the bell's clang chokes in a country silence
 <br>
thinking: <i> I might have been on that train</i>
 <br>
thinking: <i> it could have killed me.</i>

Iain Lonie</A>
<hr>


Iain Lonie was once described as ``New Zealand's most troubling
absence''&mdash;absent from all the anthologies and from New Zealand
itself for much of his life. He was actually born in Cambridgeshire
(in March of all places).  By trade he was a classical scholar, with a
particular interest in Greek Medicine, and this took him to Cambridge
at various times to study, tho' it was not in Cambridge that i met him.

<br> He died in 1989, and his poetry is not going to be better known
until something happens to make the NZ poets of his generation more
fashionable. Perhaps that something will turn out to be the
recent (May 2015) publication by Otago University Press of the Complete
Lonie (with a modest subvention from your humble correspondent).  And
about time too, one might add.  Let's see who reads it....
