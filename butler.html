 Tobacco had nowhere been forbidden in the Bible, but then it had not
yet been discovered, and had probably only escaped proscription for
this reason. We can conceive of St. Paul or even our Lord Himself as
drinking a cup of tea, but we cannot imagine either of them as smoking
a cigarette or a churchwarden [pipe]. Ernest could not deny this, and
admitted that Paul would almost certainly have condemned tobacco in
good round terms if he had known of its existence. Was it not then
taking rather a mean advantage of the Apostle to stand on his not
having actually forbidden it? On the other hand, it was possible that
God knew Paul would have forbidden smoking, and had purposely arranged
the discovery of tobacco for a period at which Paul should be no
longer living. This might seem rather hard on Paul, considering all he
had done for Christianity, but it would be made up to him in other
ways.

Samuel Butler: The Way of All Flesh <hr> <br>A churchwarden is not a church official
but a kind of pipe for smoking tobacco.  <p> This is not only  a masterpiece of 
sustained low-key sarcasm (as is the whole book, come to that); it is also an object
lesson in the dangers attendant upon attempts to squeeze out of a text more
meaning than it actually contains.  
Much of the theological exegesis one reads is no more sensible than
1970's Beatles fans thinking that Paul was dead because he is dressed
in black in the picture on the cover of <i>Abbey Road</i>.  
One is reminded of the flight of Brian of
Nazareth from his new and unwelcome horde of disciples, during which
he loses one of his sandals.  They come across the sandal during their
pursuit of him and one of them [played by Spike Milligan?] says ``He has left
us his shoe!'' wondering what He might have meant by it.
