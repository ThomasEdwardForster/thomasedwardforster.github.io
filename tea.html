</h2> <hr> Religion has a way of reaching into all corners of the
human condition: how did the spirit become flesh, become human?  The
problem of becoming human is one we all face first thing every
morning; for my part I find that a nice strong cup of tea usually does
the trick.  Works for me. Why is it supposed to be such a mystery?
