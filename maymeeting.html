CAMELEON (CAMbridgE LEeds Or Norwich) exists to further links
between logicians at the three universities its name alludes to.  It has funding from
<A HREF ="http://www.lms.ac.uk/"> The
London Mathematical Society </A> and <A HREF
="http://www.stlukesinstitute.org.uk"> The St Luke's Institute.  </A>

 <p> The next meeting is on thursday 26 May.  Venue: Meeting Room 11, Centre for
Mathematical Sciences, Wilberforce Road, Cambridge. 


 <p> 

Speakers (so far).  Thomas Forster, Aldo Antonelli, John Truss, Imre Leader.
Times are extremely flexible.

Title: The Homomorphism Problem for $\beta N$.
 <p>
Abstract: The space $\beta N$ of ultrafilters on the natural numbers has
a natural topological and algebraic structure. One of the most fascinating of
the many unsolved problems about $\beta N$ is the `homomorphism problem': 
does there exist a non-trivial homomorphism from $\beta N$ to itself?
It turns out that this reduces to a very down-to-earth question about
ultrafilters. After giving some background, we will discuss recent
progress, including some links with a curious combinatorial problem.

 <p> Title:

FIRST-ORDER NUMERICAL ABSTRACTION
 <p> 
There are two main reduction strategies for arithmetic: according to the 
first strategy, originating with Frege and Russell, the natural number 
are identified with equivalence classes under the equinumerosity 
relation. The second strategy, championed by Zermelo and von Neuman, 
rather identifies particular representatives of those equivalence 
classes. The former approach is usually thought to be more general, but 
suffers the drawback of being intrinsically higher-order; the latter 
approach can be carried out at the first-order but at the price of 
identifying the natural numbers with a particular kind of entities.
 <p> 
Here we present a way to carry out the Frege-Russell reduction of 
arithmetic at the first-order. Our main tool is the introduction of a 
slight (?) generalization of the standard first-order quantifiers, 
"there is" and "for all". In particular, after introducing the 
first-order (!) binary quantifier Fx(A,B) stating that there are no more 
As than BS, along with a heterogenous predicate cosnstant N(x,A) to the 
effect that x numbers the As, we propose arithmetical axioms for such a 
language, exploring exactly how much of arithmetic can be captured in 
the resulting system.

Generic Automorphisms and Circular orders
 <p>
J. K. Truss
 <p> 
Generic automorphisms of three particular homogeneous structures are
considered, as an ordered set, the countable universal homogeneous
partial order, and the random graph. I study the existence of mutually
generic automorphisms, and three possible definitions of what this
could mean.  <hr>

The next meeting will be in Cambridge on thursday 23rd or fri 24th November.
Speakers will include Greg Restall of ANU and Allen Mann of Colorado.

If you want to come to the meeting tell tf@dpmms.cam.ac.uk so
we can get a good fix on numbers.  There will be a supper after the
meeting.  Definitely tell
tf if you wish to stay for this!
