Logic and Rhetoric <p>

<HEAD>
Cambridge, the weekend of 28th-29th October 2006.  Meeting Room 5, the Centre for Mathematical Sciences,  Wilberforce Road, Cambridge.

<p></b>

Logic in the modern age is predominantly Mathematical Logic; it has
been immensely useful and is greatly to be cherished. However, we should not
forget that most of the time reasoning is not used for anything as innocent and
benign as merely proving theorems or teasing out consequences of
scientific hypotheses, but to transact power relations.  By the same
token one tends to forget that some of the earlier works to which the
historians of Modern Logic trace its origins (Church's bibliography is
a good source) are in fact treatises on - or essays in - Rhetoric.
<p>
    The purpose of this conference will be to explore the other - and
darker - uses of Logic and to remind ourselves of its neglected roots
in Rhetoric.  <p> Papers are invited on topics related to these
themes.  This may appeal to people in Commonsense Reasoning, in
Political Science and in Linguistics as well as to people in History
of Logic.  One particular interest of mine is the nature of rhetorical
devices used in philosophical debate.  <br>
The participants are Edwin
Coleman, Charles Pigden, Richard Boyd, Jamie Dow, Karin Verelst,
Constantin Athanasopoulos, Nicholas Shackel, Thomas Forster and Piers
Bursill-Hall.  <p>

The conference is being funded by the St. Luke's Institute. (St Luke's
also funded Buddhism In Logic and Analytic Philosophy:
www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/BILAP.html, and the proceedings of BILAP are
being prepared for publication even as I write this).  The plan is
that the proceedings will appear in a special number of Logique et
Analyse.

<A HREF = "shackelLandR.txt"> Rhetorical Manoeuvres, Sophistry and Pragmatism <A/>.


A traditional pastime of philosophers is analysing sophistry. Some
rhetorical manoeuvres border on subtle rejections of the normative
status philosophers have traditionally accorded logical principles of
reasoning. This paper considers whether some such manoeuvres amount to
or can be grounded in a pragmatist challenge to certain conceptions of
rationality, or whether they can be dismissed as sophistical.
