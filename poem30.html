<p>


When I lie down where I had lain with you<br>
Some many nights, beloved, of the days<br>
Lit by your sun, I dreamed all touch untrue,<br>
Error my star and darkness all my ways<br>
Till where I lie, I lie again with you.<br>
<p>
Till where I go, I go again with you <br>
Through all the days, beloved, and the nights<br>
By your sweet self illumined, I can do<br>
Not one good thing: not till your beauty lights<br>
Me where I go, and go again with you.<br>

Monogamy may not be all the rage these days but there isn't a whole lot wrong with it.
This poem is one of several works that speaks of the power of the love of one man for
one woman.. as instance the Taj Mahal ... and the love-song John Lennon wrote to Yoko
... <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF6e-NmwmnA">woman,</A>... not his best
work, but it came from the heart.

<hr> Curiously&mdash;such is my ignorance&mdash;it was only the other day that
i learnt that Borodin was a 'cello player and his wife a fiddle
player, so the nocturne from the D-maj quartet is a love duet: the
melody is first played by the 'cello and the first fiddle responds....
