<br>Subject  	[FOM] James Shaw on philosophy of mathematics


<br>I have just picked up a copy of:
<br>
    Lectures on the Philosophy of Mathematics
<br>
 by one James Byrnie Shaw.  Open Court 1918. 
<br>
It occurred to me to wonder that it is only recently
that people starting publishing books with names like this. 
Is this one perhaps the first?

W.M. Gillespie published a book titled``Philosophy of Mathematics" in
1851, a translated excerpt from Comte's <i> Cours de Philosophie Positive</i>. 
I do not know whether Comte used any such title for any part of his Cours. 
<br>
I suspect that history would show two related reasons why these titles
start to appear:  First is the professorialization of philosophy, which
really only began in Germany in the 1700s and only became really serious
in the 1800s.  So in the 1800s you started to get specialized,
professional, professorial ``philosophies of" various things.  But the
specific professor who most kicked this off was Hegel who, contrary to
his reputation in some quarters today, paid enormous attention to the
particulars of the sciences in his time and insisted they should have
systematic comprehensive philosophical treatments <i> besides</i> the
practical treatment of them by scientists.  
<br>
Notably his ``Philosophy of Nature" in his Encyclopedia of Philosophical
Sciences (several successively larger editions) has a substantial
section on mathematics.  Comte would disagree with him, but precisely
so!  Philosophers attacking Hegel could and would attack him (among
other ways) by attacking him on specific sciences, as Comte would on
mathematics.
<br>
For Kant the philosophy of mathematics was still an aspect of a
philosophical account of perception.  For Hegel, mathematics per se has
a philosophical aspect.

Don't know. But google turns up a  <A HREF = "http://projecteuclid.org/handle/euclid.bams/1183424915"> review </A> of it in the Bulletin of the
American Mathematical Society:


<br>
And he does appear on the  <A HREF = "http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=4828&fChrono="> Mathematics Genealogy Project </A>

but not with much info. One interesting fact is that he was the first
Purdue PhD in maths. See <A HREF = "http://www.science.purdue.edu/centennial/trivia.asp"> here: </A>

number 10. And the book itself is available <A HREF = "http://www.archive.org/details/50406541">here<A/>:

for anyone who wants to have a look.

I don't have any direct personal knowledge of the person or the  
period, but the British Library does list a few books on the  
philosophy of mathematics at an earlier date. The earliest in English  
I can see is:
<br>
BLEDSOE, Albert Taylor. The Philosophy of Mathematics, etc. (pp. 248.  
J. B. Lippincott & Co.: Philadelphia, 1868.)
<br>
There doesn't seem to be much before the book you found though. James  
Byrnie Shaw is listed as author of two other books: one on vector  
calculus and the other on linear associative algebra.
<br>
Most seem available on amazon (which is rather alarming). The linear  
algebra book from 1907 is listed as ``in stock" at amazon.co --  
confirmation that mathematics books don't age? 
<br>
<A HREF ="http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-linear-associative-algebra-development/dp/1429704349/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212484998&sr=8-3">On $16.99:</A>
<br>
Amazon.com knows more of his books than the British Library, which is  
no surprise.
<br>
Not really an answer to your question, but maybe some data points.

An earlier occurrence than the ones in Thomas Forster's report can be found in the electronic
catalogue of Göttingen University Library. Part of its record is pasted here:
