 ``1950, beginning with the OM and ending with the Nobel, seems
  to have marked the apogee of my respectability. It is true that i
  began to feel slightly uneasy, fearing that this might mean the
  onset of blind orthodoxy. I have always held that no-one can be
  respectable without being wicked, but so blunted was my moral sense
  that I could not see in what way I had sinned.''

Bertrand Russell (Autobiography volume III) <hr>Russell was of course
a completely impossible person, but there is much in him to love.
However much he might protest, the author of this remark was <i>
born</i> to respectability&mdash;he was the heir to a political family
of the ruling class, and nothing could be more natural to him than to
go into the House of Lords (of which of course he was a member, as of
right) and tell everybody what's what&mdash;which of course he
proceded to do.  However, he was also an instinctive anarchist: the
last sentence reveals a deep humility which his detractors often miss,
and without which he could never have become the great thinker that he
was. Russell never thought he knew everything, never thought he was
God; (this is why we love Russell but not Wittgenstein); he <i>
cared</i>&mdash;passionately&mdash;but he never <i> believed</i>.
Not for nothing did someone (Alan Wood) once write a psychobiography
called ``Bertrand Russell, the passionate sceptic''.
