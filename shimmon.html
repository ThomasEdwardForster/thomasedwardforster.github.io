``use of the word `appropriate' is often itself inappropriate''.

<p>

 ..thereby making `appropriate' heterological.  I'm sure John Shimmon
 (for it is he, one of our administrators in DPMMS) would rather it
 were homological (like him).  But you can't have everything in this life,
 particularly if you are Irish and living in Britain, co's everyone's
 taking the mickey.  Except he's a Prod.  <p>I think i'd better stop.
