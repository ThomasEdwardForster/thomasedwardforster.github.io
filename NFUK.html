NF 70th Anniversary Meeting
<p><hr>



Cambridge, the weekend of 26th-27th May 2007.  Meeting Room 4, the Centre for Mathematical Sciences,  Wilberforce Road, Cambridge.

<p>

Definite attendees: Marcel Crabbe, Thierry Libert, Andre Petry, Randall Holmes, Ali Enayat, Thomas Forster, Sergei Tupailo, Dang Vu,   Athanasios Tzouvaras, Olivier Esser.
<p>

<p>

The conference is being funded by the St. Luke's Institute. (St Luke's
also funded (i) <A HREF ="BILAP.html">
Buddhism In Logic and Analytic Philosophy:<A/> whose proceedings are
being prepared for publication even as I write this; and (ii) <A HREF
="LandR.html"> Logic and Rhetoric <A/> whose
proceedings will appear in a special number of Logique et Analyse.
It is not clear at this stage what will happen to the proceedings of
NF 2007)


<p>

<hr> Provisional Programme

   We will not start talks until saturday mid-morning.

Dang Vu <p>

Title: S and HS<p>

A very short introduction to the stratified constructible S hierarchy,
with some comments on its similarities/differences with respect to the
constructible universe L and the class HS of hereditarily symmetric
sets.<p>

"A Forster term model of TST"<p>

A Forster term model of a set theory is a model in which all elements
are parameter-free set abstracts.  In the case of TST, we must also
allow type 0 constants.  Solovay has proved using standard techniques
from the theory of constructible sets that there is a Forster term
model of TST.  I have realized that a structure that I described to
Thomas Forster during a visit in 1998 actually seems to be a Forster
term model (in fact, probably the same one Solovay described).  I will
outline my proof of this fact.  Nothing in my talk should be
attributed to Solovay, nor should anything I say be construed as
denying Solovay priority for this result (in particular, while I did
describe this structure in 1998, I had no reason to believe it was a
Forster term model and I was in fact fairly certain it was not).<p><hr>

What NFU knows about Cantorian objects<p>

In what follows NFU is Jensen's modification of Quine's NF, NFU(+) is
NFU augmented with the axiom of infinity, and choice and NFU(-) is NFU plus the
negation of the axiom of infinity.  We plan to discuss various results
about extensions of NFU(+/-), in particular:<p>

1. The `equivalence' of the following two theories:<p>

(a) NFU(+) augmented with the axiom "every Cantorian set is strongly
 Cantorian" ;<p>

(b) Godel-Bernays theory of classes plus the axiom "the class of
ordinals is weakly compact".<p>


2 . The `equivalence' of the following two theories:<p>

(a) NFU(-) augmented with the axiom "every Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian";
<p>
(b) ACA_0 (the predicative extension of Peano ArithmetiAc)

Ambiguous Cardinals <p> A cardinal number k is termed ''ambiguous" if
it is indiscernible from 2 to the power of k. In a more specific way,
k is ambiguous if the natural typed structure over a set X of size k
is elementarily equivalent to the natural structure over the power set
of X. Thanks to this notion, different results stemming from Specker's
disproof of the axiom of choice will be extracted from the NF milieu
and recast in the framework of the politically correct set theory

 Title:<p>

 "NF and indiscernibles in ZF"<p>

 Abstract:<p>

 We show how NF (Quine's "New Foundations") can be seen as a special
 (inner) model of ZF. First, we give a sufficient condition for [the famous
 long-standing open problem of] NF consistency. Next, in the ZF
 language, we will present a much simplified Specker's refutation of AC
 in NF (= in that model of ZF).
