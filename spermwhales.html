I'm not the kind of mathematician who is rude about engineers.  <br>
I take the piss out of them of course, but then I'm a Brit and taking the 
piss is what Brits do.<br>  I am lost in admiration of engineers: they can
actually DO things. <p> In contrast, being a pure mathematician is a bit
like being a sperm whale: you may have the largest brain in the Animal
Kingdom but you lack an opposable thumb.
