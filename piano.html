Dum vixi tacui, mortua dulce cano*

<hr> I saw this inscribed on the lid of
a&mdash;modern&mdash;harpsichord at a concert in college. It's so
sweet. But of course it's not the piano talking, it's the <i>wood</i>
from which the piano is <i>made</i> that is doing the talking.  One
can make use of this quotation in discussions of <A HREF
="mereology.html"> mereology </A> and suchlike, you know, two objects
inhabiting the same substance (and of course having contradictory
properties ... you can have a lot of fun with that).  <p>

Actually if a piano could talk it wouldn't speak latin; it would play
Schumann&mdash;probably the Kreisleriana.
<p>
...except under compulsion of course.
In Berlioz, in the <i>Evenings
in the Orchestra</i>&mdash;Eighteenth Evening  (I was made
to read Berlioz when I was a music student&mdash;and i still prefer his prose to his music ... nasty bangy stuff ... Wagner and Liszt liked it; <A HREF="bizetonberlioz.html"> Bizet didn't...</A>) is the story of the new
piano that gets beaten into shape by a succession of students at the finals of a competition
&mdash; lots of performances of the one piano concerto
(the Mendelssohn G minor) and when the last student gets up
and leaves, the piano starts all over again out of sheer force of habit.
<p>
And it plays <i>Mendelssohn</i>, the poor thing. 
<hr>
Actually there's probably a whole <i>genre</i> out there along these lines. One i quite like is ``If a machine-gun could talk it would speak Castilian''.

*In life i was silent.  In death i sing sweetly
