<p>



I am that which began;<br>
Out of me the years roll;<br>
Out of me God and Man;<br>
I am equal and whole;<br>
God changes, and Man, and the form of them bodily; I am the Soul.  <p>


Before ever land was,<br>
Before ever the sea,<br>
Or soft hair of the grass,<br>
Or fair limbs of the tree,<br>
Or the fresh-coloured fruit of my branches, I was, and thy soul was in me.
 <p>
First life on my sources<br>
First drifted and swam;<br>
Out of me are the forces<br>
That save it or damn;<br>
Out of me man and woman, and wild-beast and bird; before God was, I am.
					    <p>


Algernon Charles Swinburne

This is only the first three verses.  (There are forty-odd more, but these
are the only verses that i have by heart; don't ask).  Hertha was (is?) the
Earth Goddess, Germanic version (it's an obviously Germanic word).  And of
course Hertha is a Godd<i>ess</i>; in every language known to me that has
genders, <i>Sky</i> is a masculine noun and <i>Earth</i> is a feminine noun.
<p>
`I am that which began...''.  Of course on the face of it it's the Goddess speaking, but it's also the
poem speaking, or rather the first line of the poem:  ``I am that which began'' is, indeed, that which began...

I encountered this in the appendix (i think) of something written by
E.M.W. Tillyard.  I cannot now remember what it was or how i came to
be reading it&mdash;a volume of literary criticism for heavan's sake!
Tillyard was the grandfather of my colleague

but that was not why i was reading it, long before i knew Greg.

Swinburne is fatally easy to parody&mdash;in the first instance all you
need is the sense of rhythm&mdash;but some (not many) of the parodies are
very memorable indeed.  But this is a noble piece
that makes all the parodies look unworthy.  <hr>
But i'll leave you with the first few verses of Owen Seaman's
wonderful parody .......
<p><p>


In the days of my season of salad,
<br> When the down was as dew on my cheek,
<br>And for French I was bred on the ballad,
<br>For Greek on the writers of Greek, —
<br>Then I sang of the rose that is ruddy,
<br>Of 'pleasure that winces and stings,'
<br>Of white women and wine that is bloody,
<br>
And similar things.
<p>
Of Delight that is dear as Desi-er,
<br>And Desire that is dear as Delight ;
<br>Of the fangs of the flame that is fi-er,
<br>Of the bruises of kisses that bite ;
<br>Of embraces that clasp and that sever,
<br>Of blushes that flutter and flee
<br>Round the limbs of Dolores, whoever
<br>Dolores may be.
<p>
I sang of false faith that is fleeting
<br>As froth of the swallowing seas,
<br> Time's curse that is fatal as Keating
<br>Is fatal to amorous fleas ;
<br>Of the wanness of woe that is whelp of
<br>The lust that is blind as a bat —
<br>By the help of my Muse and the help of
<br>The relative <i>that</i>.
<p> [snip]
<hr>
Keating's powder was a victorian preparation which was supposed to kill fleas.
