Hi Thomas,

Here are the title and an abstract of my talk.

Title: Dharmakirti, Frege and Kant on the Nature of Logic

Abstract:
Kant held that (pure general) logic is a maximally general science. He
took this to mean that logic is concerned with understanding (and
thought) as such. Moreover, he inferred from this that logic deals with
abstractions from the objects that we sense (as oppose to
conceptualise). Frege rejected this inference of Kant and argued that
logic does tell us something, in fact a lot, about  objects (i.e.,
numbers), etc., though his argument isn't as strong as one might hope.
Now, the major Buddhist logician (from a Tibetan point of view),
Dharmakirti, seems to have held a view of logic very similar to Frege's.
His view seems to be that, though logic is concerned with understanding
(and thought) as such, it can tell us objective truths about the objects
that we perceive (though logic isn't grounded in the objects). Thus, by
demonstrating that Dharmakirti's view of logic is coherent and arguing
for the view, we can show that Frege's refutation of Kant's view is
successful. It is envisioned that this will lead to a reinvigoration of
Frege's conception of logic which has given way to Tarski's
metamathematical approach to logic.
