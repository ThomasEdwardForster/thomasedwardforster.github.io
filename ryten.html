<P>Dear Thomas, here's a little abstract.</P>
<P>ALMOST THEORIES</P>
<P>Let $\L$ be a language, and $\C$ some class of $\L$-structures. The&nbsp;almost theory &nbsp;of $\C$ is the $\L$-theory comprising sentences true of almost all members of $\C$.&nbsp;&nbsp; The almost &nbsp;theory of $\C$ is exactly the theory of all non-principal ultraproducts of members of $\C$.\\</P>
<P>Other than knowing the almost theory exists, it is difficult to say anything more.&nbsp; Is it decidable? Does it have a nice description?\\</P>
<P>We will discuss several&nbsp;almost theories from&nbsp; algebra.&nbsp; Primarily, we'll describe&nbsp;&nbsp;axiomatisations&nbsp;&nbsp;using&nbsp;&nbsp; classical &nbsp;facts in algebraic geometry. &nbsp;But we'll also&nbsp;mention &nbsp;some deep generalisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classes involved are these:</P>
<P>(i) finite fields\\</P>
<P>(ii) finite difference fields. (A difference field is a pair $(F, \sigma)$ where $F$ is a field and $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $F$. In this case $\L$ is the language of difference rings. That language is the language of rings augmented by a unary function symbol.)\\</P>
<P>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;finite simple groups\\</P>
