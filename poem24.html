This bloody town's a bloody cuss <br>
No bloody trains, no bloody bus,
<br>And no one cares for bloody us <br>In bloody Orkney.  <p> The
bloody roads are bloody bad, <br>The bloody folks are bloody mad,
<br>They'd make the brightest bloody sad, <br>In bloody Orkney.<br>  <p>
All bloody clouds, and bloody rains, <br>No bloody kerbs, no bloody
drains, <br>The Council's got no bloody brains, <br>In bloody Orkney.
<p> Everything's so bloody dear, <br>A bloody bob, for bloody beer,
<br>And is it good? - no bloody fear, <br>In bloody Orkney.  <p> The
bloody 'flicks' are bloody old, <br>The bloody seats are bloody cold,
<br>You can't get in for bloody gold <br>In bloody Orkney.  <p> The
bloody dances make you smile, <br>The bloody band is bloody vile,
<br>It only cramps your bloody style, <br>In bloody Orkney.  <p>
No bloody sport, no bloody games, <br>No bloody fun, the bloody
dames <br>Won't even give their bloody names <br>In bloody Orkney.
<p> Best bloody place is bloody bed, <br>With bloody ice on bloody
head, <br>You might as well be bloody dead, <br>In bloody Orkney <br>
<p>

There's nothing greets your bloody eye <br>
But bloody sea and bloody sky,<br>
'Roll on demob!' we bloody cry<br>
In bloody Orkney.

I seem to remember that the author was a sailor posted at Scapa Flow.
That would explain it.  It needs explaining beco's apparently
Orcadians are generally friendly.  Non-stop party-time: lots of pubs
and only one bobby.  The trouble is - thanks to oil money and price
gouging by airlines - it costs you an arm and a leg to get
there - sorry, a <i>bloody</i> arm and leg.<p>

Actually, the internet has supplied this riposte from the locals:

<p>
<i>Captain Hamish 'Bloody' Blair<br>
Isnae posted here nae mair<br>
But no-one seems tae bloody care<br>
In bloody Orkney.</i>
<p>

This stanza is certainly in the right spirit, but I'm not entirely convinced.  It appears to be pretty standard lowland scots, which is not what they speak in the Orkneys. But i don't bloody care.
