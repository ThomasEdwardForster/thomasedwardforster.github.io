This year some of you are doing the Part III essay on 
<A HREF ="partiiiessay1.pdf"> Set Theory Without the Axiom of Foundation </A>




<hr>

Last year three part III students did the essay on <A HREF =
"partiiiessay2.pdf"> Better Quasi-orders </A>.  As a result I
organised a reading group on BQO theory, and it was a great success.
Several of the people who attended last year will be around in
2010/11 and would be up for a rerun.  These include Zachiri McKenzie
and Nathan Bowler and your humble correspondent.
<p>
(While we are on this subject I should mention that Wilfried Buchholz has allowed me to display here his
<i>very</i> cute proof of the multiset ordering theorem.  <A HREF
="buch.ps"> Read it and improve your soul. </A>)<p>



<hr> <b> Left-over Set Theory materials from years before
2010/11</b><br> This section will be tidied up: the thought is that if
there is to be a reading course on set theory in 2010/11 then this page
will host material useful to its participants.<p>

<b> The current thought is that if there is to be a demand for a
reading course in set theory then the book-to-be-read will be</b> <i>
Thomas Jech, Set Theory</i> <b> available from Springer.</b> <p>

 <A HREF = "partiii2009.pdf"> Last Year's (Set Theory) Lecture Notes </A> are 
are provided, at readers' own risk.

If you are interested in pursuing set theory at all then you may well
be curious about the foundational role of set theory and wonder where
the axioms came from and what they are supposed to do.  <A
HREF="axiomsofsettheory.pdf"> An Introduction to the Axioms of Set
Theory </A> (which is the current draught of a short book I am writing
for CUP) just might be part of what you are looking for.

The choice-free version of the Erd&ouml;s-Rado theorem is not in the
notes as I'm writing it up for publication, and 
<A HREF ="erdosrado.pdf"> here </A> is the version that has now appeared in 
the JSL.

 <p> 

Here is my  <A HREF ="fundamentalsequence.pdf"> Tutorial on Countable Ordinals  </A>.

<p>


I hope Timothy Chow won't mind me putting in this link to his notes of
<A HREF ="http://alum.mit.edu/www/tchow/forcing.pdf">
<A HREF ="http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/mathstuff/forcingdum">

forcing for beginners....</A>.

The proof that Rieger-Bernays permutation models preserve stratified 
formulae is in, for example, my  <A HREF =
"churchlatest.ps"> Church festschrift paper </A>.  The proof that they
preserve the axiom of replacement i am leaving as an exercise.

<p><A HREF ="HSnonce.ps"> Here </A> is an explanation of why the sets hereditarily of finite support form a model of ZF (minus foundation and choice)
 <p> <p> <hr> Here are notes of Woodin's lectures on Large cardinals
and determinacy. <A HREF ="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart1.pdf"> Part 1
</A>, <A HREF ="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart2.pdf"> Part 2 </A> , <A HREF
="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart3.pdf"> Part 3 </A> , <A HREF
="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart4.pdf"> Part 4 </A> and <A HREF
="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart5.pdf"> Part 5 </A> .<br> I would very much
like to lecture this one day, co's it is <i>very</i> cute, but it
won't be this year.  I am told that the first file is of notes taken
by Ernst Schimmerling, and the remainder are taken by Joan Bagaria.
They could be source material for a reading course, but it would be
a Part IV course not a Part III course.

I also include here assorted miscellaneous teaching materials that punters might find helpful, but which are not directly alluded to...

<p> 
For the moment there appears to be only one item not directly connected with this year's Part III course:

<A HREF ="henkin.pdf"> My commentary on Henkin's papers on omega-incompleteness </A>
