Title: Hrushovski amalgamation classes and strong order properties.
<p>
Abstract: We look at the model theory of a class of structures first
constructed in 1988 by Ehud Hrushovski using a variation on the method of
amalgamation classes. We are particularly interested in where these
structures fit in Shelah's hierarchy of strong order properties SOP_n. This
is joint work with my former PhD student Mark Wong.
