If you are reading this page then you are probably a supervisee of
mine looking for a slot for a supervision.  I am in hiding at a
secret location in New Zealand, and the time difference between
me and the UK is as follows:


From 27/ix until 25/x         I am 12 hrs ahead of BST   (UK summer time ends 25/x)
From 25/x until 29/iii        I am 13 hrs ahead of GMT   (UK summer time starts 29/iii)
From 29/iii until 4/iv        I am 12 hrs ahead of GMT   (NZ daylight saving ends 4/iv)
From 4/iv until 27/ix         I am 11 hrs ahead of BST   (NZ daylight saving starts 27/ix)


I have written out below a mass of slots when I am available to supervise.
These slots are put up on the assumption that any student wishing to book
them is in the UK time zone.  It may be that you are in some other time
zone and a different window might suit better.  If that is the case please
contact me and we can negotiate a different time.  Almost any time zone you
might be in is easier for me than the UK!

I offer the following times which can be claimed without negotiation - just
email me.  Other times may be available by negotiation (if you like early
morning supervisions or are in a different time zone.)   All times GMT.
The zoom number and password is below.  Just sign in: i do not routinely
send out invitations, so don't wait to be asked!

As slots get taken i shall not delete them, but insert the name of the
people i am expecting to see.  That way if you forget the time of your
slot, you can check here!)

I welcome supervision work in the form of pdf files sent as attachments.
If you happen to use LaTeX then by all means send me the LaTeX source
code so i can annotate it and return it to you.

My zoom number is 291-819-7812.  The password is: jacinda
My mobile # is +64-27-771-1729. (Easy to remember!)

All times BST.  I would prefer to have as many supervisions
in the morning my time as possible in order not to impact my
social life, such as it is.  I realise that this cannot be
avoided altogether but i am going to try to fill morning slots
first.    So please pick evening slots BST if you can. If you
cannot make 2100 you have the right to insist on a morning slot!
