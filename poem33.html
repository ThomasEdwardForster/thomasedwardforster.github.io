<br>
The boy stood in the dining Hall 
<br>
whence all but he had fled
<br>
His waistcoat was unbuttoned
<br>
He crammed himself with bread
<br>
"This is my fifteenth cup of tea" he cried in accents wild
<br>
"Just one more crust before I bust"
<br>
He was a vulgar child.

God knows where this comes from.  I learnt it from my father.   
If the sources on the internet are to be believed the version that 
has reached me is truncated. But the bits that survive are better
in this version than in the others. It's obviously a parody of
`The boy stood on the burning deck.'....

It may be worth recording that according to the oral tradition through which this poem reached me `waistcoat' is pronounced `weskit'; you need that to make it scan.
