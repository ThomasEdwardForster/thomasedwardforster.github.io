<br>
Thou who, when fears attack
<br>bids them avaunt, and black
<br>care, at the horsesman's back
<br>perching, unseatest
<br>Sweet when the morn is grey
<br>Sweet when they've cleared away
<br>lunch, and at close of day
<br>possibly sweetest
<p>
<br>I have a liking old
<br>for thee, tho' manifold
<br>stories, I know are told
<br> not to thy credit
<br> how those who use fusees
<br> all grow, by small degrees
<br> brainless as chimpanzees
<br> meagre as lizards
<br>grow mad, and beat their wives
<br>plunge, after shocking lives<br>razors and carving knives<br>into their gizzards<br><br>


    Confound such knavish tricks!<br>
    Yet know I five or six<br>
    Smokers who freely mix<br>
       Still with their neighbours;<br>
    Jones &mdash; (who, I'm glad to say,<br>
    Asked leave of Mrs. J.) -<br>
    Daily absorbs a clay<br>
       After his labours.<br>
<p>
    Cats may have had their goose<br>
    Cooked by tobacco-juice;<br>
    Still why deny its use<br>
       Thoughtfully taken?<br>
    We're not as tabbies are:<br>
    Smith, take a fresh cigar!<br>
    Jones, the tobacco-jar!<br>
       Here's to thee, Bacon!<p>
      <hr>
Bacon is of course the tobacconist in Rose Crescent, in Cambridge, who kept Calverley supplied.<p>
"Black Care" is an echo of the Latin poet Horace, Odes 3.1.41: post equitem sedet atra Cura (Black Care sits behind the horseman).
<p>
Tobacco juice is a popular remedy against deer invading your garden, and a pleasant side effect (for some) is that it repels cats as well. You make it by soaking a plug of chewing tobacco in water.
<p>
A "fusee" is a match that stays alight even in a strong wind.

A "clay" is of course a clay pipe.
