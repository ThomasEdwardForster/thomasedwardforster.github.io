Gerald Sacks on Mathematical Logic:
<p>
  ``Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. The subject of mathematical
logic splits fourfold into: recursive functions, the heart of the
subject; proof theory, which includes the best theorem in the subject;
sets and classes, <i> whose romantic appeal far outweigh their
mathematical substance</i>; and model theory, whose value is its
applicability to, and roots in, algebra.''  <br> (my italics!)  <hr>
This page is in deep freeze for the moment, since there is no plan to
offer this course in the near future. In any case I have no settled
view on what to do in Part IV even when it is offered.  There seem to be four sensible
possibilities:<br> <FONT SIZE="+1"> (1) A sequel to Part III Set
theory and Logic.  That is to say, a bit more of everything<br> (2) A
course in Alternative Set theories: Quine, Positive set theory,
Antifoundation.<br> (3) A course in Quine set theory<br> (4) A course
on large cardinals, determinacy, elementary embeddings etc.

<hr>
The advantage of (1) is that it would be easy to do and probably quite useful.  However much of the material that I would put in it would be stuff that would go into another Part III Logic course if there were such a thing, and that would make it into something not really in the spirit of Part IV.<br>(2) and (3) would definitely be in the spirit of Part IV, and would also be easy.  However they would be less useful than (1)<br>   
The drawback to (4) is that I am not really competant to give such a
course.  So why is the idea even being floated?  I have here some
notes (believed to be by Joan Bagaria) of a lecture course of Woodin's
of this nature:<A HREF ="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart1.pdf"> Part 1
</A>, <A HREF ="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart2.pdf"> Part 2 </A> , <A HREF
="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart3.pdf"> Part 3 </A> , <A HREF
="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart4.pdf"> Part 4 </A> and <A HREF
="woodinLargeCardsDetcypart5.pdf"> Part 5 </A> .<br>

Zachiri McKenzie has supplied me with the following 
article on  <A HREF="LCFDsettheory.pdf"> large cardinals and determinacy </A>.
I am not sure of the copyright status of this article, so please do not try to download it. <br>


I see no immediate prospect of my mastering this material well enough
to lecture it myself.  However, a reading group for these notes could
be a very sensible use of a Part IV slot; last year's reading group got
about twenty pages into Part 1 in 2008, and I for one would be game to
try again, and so might Nathan Bowler (the other member of that group
who will still be in Cambridge in 2008/9).<br>
One small output of that reading group was a start on a set of \LaTeX-ed
notes based on this ms which I hope to make available.  Rather than
construct a wiki (which I suppose I really ought to) I have instead
made the file of \LaTeX source code writable by anyone in the world!  This
means, Dear Reader, that you can Do Your Bit for The Rebuilding of The
Tower of Babel by adding material to it. It's on my home directory and
is called suslin.tex.

I hope Timothy Chow won't mind me putting in this link to his notes of
<A HREF ="http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/mathstuff/forcingdum">forcing for beginners....</A> (If this link doesn't work for you  edit the window to remove the reference to dpmms. Not sure why my server puts that in ....) 
There is a later version  
<A HREF ="http://alum.mit.edu/www/tchow/forcing.pdf"> here. </A>,
