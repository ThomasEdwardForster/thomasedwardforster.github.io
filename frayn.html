If a lion could talk, it wouldn't understand itself.

 Michael Frayn</A>, <i>Fog-like Sensations </i> <hr><p> I am a huge
 fan of Michael Frayn.  Have been for years, ever since I read his
 pieces in the Observer in my youth.  Years later I ran into my old
 schoolfriend <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Williams_(author)">Nigel
 Williams,</A> by then a famous novelist, and he promised to introduce
 me to Frayn (who is a friend of his) but he never did, the ratbag.<p>

We often dream up imaginary kinships with people we idolise, and I did
this with Frayn.  Like him, I did a first degree in Philosophy in
Britain at a time when the dead hand of Wittgenstein lay even more
heavily on the land than it does now.  (He did his degree at that
coven of Wittgensteinians, Cambridge). And this wonderful parody
suggests to me that Frayn found the experience fully as exasperating
as I did.  To judge by this parody, the experience must've really,
really, <i>really</i> annoyed him.  And it is one of those very rare
and precious things, a parody that works on the same material as the
text it parodies, <i> and does it better.</i>.  (For those of you who
were not force-fed Wittgenstein, the line that Frayn is spoofing is
``If a lion could talk, we wouldn't understand it''.)  <p> At the time
of the 1966 general election in the UK (or it might have been the 1970
election) the Observer had a feature in which it asked various fairly
visible people whom they were going to vote for.  <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Cowdrey"> Colin Cowdrey
</A>said he would vote for the Conservatives beco's they had the best
<i>team</i> (I don't think I'm making this up); <br>Frayn said <p>``I
shall vote Labour; I always do: there must be some end to the tyranny
of the fortunate''.
