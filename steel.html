James Ladyman </A> told me this wonderful joke:<p>  There is a man whose
wife is a string theorist.  One day he comes home in the middle of the
afternoon and finds her in bed with her lover.  Before he can murder
them (or whatever it is you are supposed to do in jokes like this)
she exclaims<p>

     <FONT SIZE="+1">``Darling! I can explain everything!!''</FONT></TD>
<p>

I recounted this to <A HREF ="http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/~m.steel/"> Mike Steel </A>.  His response was<p>

     <FONT SIZE="+1">``Well, maybe she could explain everything, but
she still didn't know what was going to happen next.''</FONT></TD>
