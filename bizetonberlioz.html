<hr> I think one needs to bring the concept of <i>taste</i> in here
somewhere.  I think the problem with Berlioz is not that he doesn't
have talent, the problem is that he doesn't have taste.  (And he
HECTORS you all the time!!)  And his biggest fans&mdash;Liszt and
Wagner in the first instance&mdash;were famously people with no taste
at all.  (Have you ever heard Liszt's setting of <i>Alles
Verg&auml;ngliche..</i> at the end of the otherwise rivetting Faust
Symphony, with its twelve-note row in the first movement..? It's a
complete disaster.  It's one of the things that fascinates me about
Liszt: how could someone with his wealth of ideas and acute
perceptions fuck things up so <i>completely</i>??) In fact, taking it
one step further&mdash;is it not the case that the Wagnerians
generally had no taste? Certainly Richard Strauss had no taste.
Bruckner ...?  <i>Mahler</i> ...?  Mahler certainly had <i>
something</i> but was it <i>taste</i>?  The only indisputable
exception is Wolf, who had perfect taste.  And Wolf apparently did not
rate Richard Strauss.  <p> While we are on the subject of taste,
Mahler lived long enuff to have at least had the <i>opportunity</i> of
hearing some Fritz Kreisler.  Did he in fact hear any?  And what did
he think..?

<p> But perhaps one should look further back. One thing that unites
all the Wagnerians is their shared reverence for Beethoven, and that
might be the key.  After all, Hindemith said once <i>`Mit Beethoven
f&auml;ngt die Schweinerei an'.</i>  What was Hindemith picking up?
I venture to suggest that Beethoven had no taste either. Look at the
9th symphony.  The first movement is fantastic (that ostinato, like
the first movement of the 7th!) and the scherzo is not bad, and for
the slow movement i cannot find enuff superlatives.  But the finale!
How is the finale not a complete disaster?  How could this wonderful
man write something so startlingly and unbelievably dire? So <i>
crass</i>?
