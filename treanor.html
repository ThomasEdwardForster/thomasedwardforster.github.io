It is a rather curious fact in philosophy that the data which are
undeniable to start with are always rather vague and ambiguous. You
can, for instance, say: ``there are a number of people in this room at
this moment.'' That is obviously in some sense undeniable. But when you
come to try and define what this room is, and what it is for a person
to be in a room, and how you are going to distinguish one person from
another, and so forth, you find that what you have said is most
fearfully vague and that you really do not know what you meant. That
is a rather singular fact, that everything you are really sure of
right off is something that you do not know the meaning of, and the
moment you get a precise statement you will not be sure whether it is
true or false, at least right off. The process of sound
philosophizing, to my mind, consists mainly in passing from these
obvious, vague, ambiguous things, that we feel quite sure of, to
something precise, clear, definite, which by reflection and analysis
we find is involved in the vague thing that we started with, and is,
so to speak, the real truth of which that vague thing is a sort of
shadow.

Bertie was often wrong about the details, but he always knew which things mattered.
