The superego is that part of the ego that is soluble in ethanol
<hr>

My recollection is that my friend Sarah Birks (an Aries, like your 
humble correspondent) told me she heard it from
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Zangwill"> Oliver Zangwill </A>
during her time as a med student in Cambridge. For her part <i>she</i> insists 
that she heard it from <i>me</i>.  So now we'll never know. One 
of us is cracking up.  I have no idea where i picked it up if it wasn't from her.<p>
The point of course is that it is a parody of operationalist 
definitions in science.  An operationalist definition is one that 
defines a natural phenomenon in terms of its interaction with your 
apparatus rather than in terms of the role it plays <i>vis-a-vis</i> other 
natural phenomena.  Ribonucleic <b>acid</b> is so called because it 
dissolves in alkali.  REM sleep and Slow Wave sleep are definitions 
that arise not from the physiology but from interaction with the EEG 
machine.  (EEG machines are very good at picking up eye movement).
