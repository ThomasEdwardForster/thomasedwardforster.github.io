You don't have to be a baby to cry</A><br>
All you need is for love to go wrong <br>
You don't have to be a baby to cry<br>
Or to lie awake the whole night long<p>
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears<br>
And you leave me a broken heart that's full of tears <br>
These ain't rainbows in my eyes, why should I lie <br>
You don't have to be a baby to cry <p>
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears<br>
And you leave me a broken heart that's full of tears<br>
These ain't rainbows in my eyes, why should I lie<br>
You don't have to be a baby to cry<br>
You don't have to be a baby to cry<p>

This was from 1963, when i was 15.  It was a pretty bleak period in my life, since<br>
i was half way through a five-year sentence that i was serving for a crime i never <br> committed,
but i was too gaslit (gaslighted..?) to complain and too brave to cry.

The 60s were supposed to be the Golden Age of Pop, but an awful lot of it was rubbish.<br>
We've forgotten most of the rubbish, but we've also forgotten some of the good stuff.<br> 
The Caravelles seem to have disappeared from the collective memory without trace 
&mdash; <br> which is a pity &mdash; because this performance is a minimalist masterpiece. (One thing that <br> has only 
recently struck me is the antanaclasis on `you leave me'). It does everything it's  <br> supposed
to, and leaves it at that. It delivers a simple truth eloquently. Sometimes life  <br> just <i>is</i> crap; and &mdash;
no &mdash;  you 
<i>don't</i> have to be a baby to cry, just like the girls say.<hr>
