<hr>
At one point my friend <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hawthorn"> Geoffrey Hawthorn</A> produced a tag from Hume (I cannot remember which) and, when I wistfully said ``Oh.. I love Hume'',  he replied

<p>``Thomas, <i>Everybody</i> loves Hume!''
<p>


<hr><p>

as indeed we do.  I think of Hume as like a good apple pie, if that isn't mixing my metaphors: tart but never unkind. <br>
And I love Blake too. Am I inconsistent..?<p>


<hr> On the subject of universal truths, i recall visiting my lovely
colleague Carsten Butz in Copenhagen.  We went to a local cafe to meet
a colleague of his, an administrator from Heriot-Watt.  I confessed to
her that i had an enduring ambition to &mdash; one day &mdash; do standup.
I would <i>love</i> to do standup.  Her response<p> "Thomas &mdash; <i>All</i>
academics dream of doing standup!!"
