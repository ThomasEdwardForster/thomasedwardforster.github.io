I found this appalling fount of wisdom in Plimmer's bookshop
(the <i>cognoscenti</i> will know that I was visiting Wellington) on
the day of the <i>first</i> Christchurch earthquake.  It is a chapter of a book entitled <i> Scintillae Juris</i>.
<p>
I come from a long line of lawyers on my father's side, and i have
<A HREF="https://www.2tg.co.uk/people/howard-palmer-qc/">cousins</A>
on that side of generations below mine who are lawyers still.
Just before COVID I lost a dear friend &mdash; Maurice Knuckey &mdash; barrister,
intellectual, raconteur, <i>bon vivant</i> (= high-performing substance abuser, God bless 'im), contrarian and charmer, and I missed his wake
beco's i was the wrong side of the equator at the time. I remember him complaining (not <i>toooo</i> vehemently) about
a senior colleague from long ago who ``laughed too many cases out of court''.
<P>

But less of the patter, more of the text. It's worthy of Machiavelli: astute, free of malice and entirely merciless.

It is neccessary to all who cross-examine to remember that the object of
their art is to elicit that which the witness is either reluctant to
reveal or would not tell at all if he thought it to his questioner's
benefit.  It is clear then that your aim in cross-examination is to
bring out the truth on certain points selected by yourself.
<p>
Now the thing easiest to be got in this world is the truth, if you set
about it the right way; for to speak truth is to relate what has
happened, while to lie is to tell what has not &mdash; and this requires the
imagining of what never was, and the joining of it, more or less
cleverly, to what is.
<p>
In nearly all men the imagination works but slowly; and therefore it
is well to get yourself answered quickly when you desire facts to be
disclosed, but to give time if you want the witness to palter with the
truth for the purpose of showing afterwards that he did so.
<p>
If it be asked how one may get an answer quickly, I can only reply
that a question suddenly put seems to hurry the utterance of the
witness before it touches his faculty of reflection.  Thus you may
often hear a man, who has answered a question, say ``Excuse me, but I
did not understand you''&mdash; an assertion which a smile of incredulity
easily represents as a falsehood.
<p>
If you suggest to an adverse witness a fact in his own favour, he will
often deny its existence for fear it should be to your own advantage.
<p>
 A suggestion which you desire a hostile witness to adopt should
 always be made unexpectedly, otherwise his judgement will reject it
 at the bidding of his interest.  There is a story told of
 Lord Erskine which may illustrate this position.

 ``Sir'' he said very slowly to a man who declined to pay for a coat,
 on the grounds that it did not fit him, ``do I understand you to say
 that one arm of that coat was longer than the other?''

 ``I swear it most solemnly'' replied the witness.

 ``What?'' cried Erskine, with a sudden plunge into a hurried manner;
 ``do you pledge your oath that, on the contrary, one arm was
 actually <i>shorter</i> than the other?''

 ``I do'' was the answer, given as rapidly as the question was put.
<p>
  It is generally well to indulge a witness against you who desires to
  talk much; for, when you have with affability heard all that he has
  to say, he will readily tell you what you wish to hear.  Moreover
  his garrulity will be likely to offend the jury, since they are all
  so fond of talking that they lavish much praise on silence in
  others, as poverty is lauded for a virtue because everyone wants to
  be rich.
<p>
  In all men we first notice their weak points; and therefore you
  should, for a time, encourage the display of those characteristics
  of a witness which you soonest observe; yet remember always that ,
  as there is no spot of earth where you would not find something of
  value, if you should dig deep enough, so will much stirring up of
  any man at last reveal some good quality.
<p>
  It is most difficult for a wit to be agreeable; so, if you allure a
  witness into indulging his taste for comicality, you may be sure
  that he will offend at least one of a tribunal of thirteen.
<p>
  A gruff man is commonly thought honest.  You should, therefore, play
  to such a one on the pipe of politeness, that he may look
  ill-tempered if he will not dance, and ill-mannered if he do.
<p>
  Should a witness be naturally cautious and circumspect, there is no
  resource but to give him large opportunities for reticence, that it
  may be taken for disingenuousness.
<p>
  A timid question will always receive a confident answer.
<p>
  When a witness called by the other side is inclined to behave to you
  with marked courtesy, I think it a mistake to discourage him, as some
  Counsel do.  For, though the tenor of his evidence shall be against
  you, yet many will conclude, from his manner of giving it being the
  contrary, that he is addicted to insincerity, and will be likely to
  distrust him altogether.
 <p>
  It often happens that you have to cross-examine your own witness, by
  reason of the other side having called him. In such a case it is
  wisest to conceal as much as possible the fact of his partiality; and
  I would, therefore, not cross-examine him as though he were a trusted
  friend, as is the common way.  It is well to ask him many questions;
  for he will be sure to answer favourably, and yet it looks more like a
  real cross-examination than if you should let him begin and finish his
  own story without interruption or with transparent assistance.
  <p>
    Never torture a witness longer than he will wriggle in a lively
    fashion; for it is not the pain, but the contortions of the victim
    which amuse lookers-on.
  <p>
  A compliment is a forensic anaesthetic.  Many people will
  complacently undergo a fatal interrogation if they be well flattered
  all the while; and more men are likely to be caught by a compliment
  to their ability than by a tribute to their virtue.  Perhaps even the
  best of us would rather be feared than respected or loved.
  <p>
   In cross-examining a claimant it is expedient to induce him to
   exaggerate his rights, to the end that all who hear him may feel
   their share in the wealth of mankind to be threatened by his large
   demands upon the common stock; and that thus his claims may be
   adjudged by his debtors.
  <p>
   To show that your client has, through the Defendant's conduct, lost
   something which he had before, will gain much favour for his suit;
   but to prove that he has been prevented from obtaining what he had
   a right to acquire will help him little; for who can tell from
   whose store the new supply would have been drawn?
  <p>
   It is almost always safe to attack a witness whom the judge allows
   to be hostile, and to punish him as sharply as you can; since the
   admission of an overt act of enmity is, after the oath, a
   declaration of his untruthfulness and desire to deceive the court.
   The jury at once feel that you are fighting, not your enemy only,
   but theirs also; and having, as it were, become combatants by
   champion, are anxious to see you prevail.
  <p>
    If you can make a witness appear ridiculous, it is never unsafe to
    do so; for those in ludicrous situations receive no pity, even
    though they die there.
  <p>
  Yet I think it generally a mistake to laugh at any man for his
  calling in life; as that he is a barber, a tailor or the like.  Few
  men do not think themselves more genteel than their business; and it
  is ill joking before a jury on a common foible.
  <p>
    A severe manner may often be used with success toward a witness
    with whom the jury are inclined to agree, but never against one
    with whom they sympathise. And it is not wise to try to deprive a
    person of this sympathy; for you show the foolishness of those who
    bestowed it; but rather enlarge upon how much of sympathy any one
    has, as a reason for denying him anything more substantial,
  <p>
    The knowledge that virtue is its own reward is reason enough for
    giving to the deserving nothing besides an admission of their
    goodness.
  <p>
    Sometimes it is not inartistic to affect entire belief in every
    statement made by an opponent's witness; since nothing begets
    scepticism than the contemplation of credulity.

    We must indeed be very careful how we affect unbelief in
    statements made by even the falsest; for they themselves must
    speak infinitely more truth than falsehood, and every one can see it.
  <p>
    To prove that a man is a notorious liar has its dangers, since it
    heightens the effect of every truth he tells.
    <p>
     Do not seek to sink a witness too low in the opinion of his
      judges; for it is to be observed that we hardly ever feel
      unkindly towards those who are incontestably and hopelessly
      beneath us.  An aspiring man is always disliked; but the
      greatest sinner will meet with toleration, if only he have art
      enough to be abject.
    <p>
    A display of magnaminity in dealing with the case against you
    often begets a belief in the strength of your own; for we are
    accustomed to generosity on the part only of those who have a
    superabundance for themselves.
    <p>
    Many counsel repeat every answer they obtain.  A poor artifice for
    impressing a fact on a jury; because it is but telling them that
    they can comprehend only those things which have been said twice.
    And, although it is often neccessary that a jury should not
    understand your case, it can never be advisable to show them that
    you think they cannot.
    <p>
      I have frequently heard many foolish questions put for the
      purpose of showing that a witness takes gin in his beer. I am
      sure juries generally look on that as an honest failing; and I
      would suggest to counsel who cross-examine in this way, that
      they would damage a man far more by eliciting his entire
      exemption from any conventional weakness, or commonplace vices,
      than by proving that he is not above them.
    <hr>    <hr>
    That's all from him, but before i sign off i must tell a Maurice Knuckey story.
    <p>
Maurice told me of the time he represented a serial flasher in a magistrate's court.  As it happens, the
magistrate that tried him was female, and her primate
curiosity finally overcame her (this was not the first time he had
appeared before her, so to speak) and she asked the question we all
want to ask: <p><b>``Why do you do it?''</b>  <p> and got the answer <p><b>``Co's i got a
big 'un''</b>.<p>

Well! You ask questions, you get answers; you may not know what they mean but you get them anyway.  Forty-two.
