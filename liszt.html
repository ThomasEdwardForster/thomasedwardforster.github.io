</h2> <p>``I was about eleven years old when my respected teacher Czerny
took me to see Beethoven.  He had told Beethoven about me a long time
earlier and asked him to give me a hearing some day.
However, Beethoven had such an aversion to infant prodigies that he
persistently refused to see me. At last Czerny, indefatigable,
persuaded him, so that, impatiently, he said ``Well, bring the rascal
to me, in God's name''.  It was about ten o'clock in the morning when
we entered the two small rooms in the <i>Schwarzspanierhaus</i> where
Beethoven was living at the time, myself very shy, Czerny kind and
encouraging. Beethoven was sitting at a long, narrow table near the
window, working.  For a while he scrutinised us grimly, exchanged a
few hurried words with Czerny and remained silent when my good teacher
called me to the piano.  The first thing I played was a short piece by
Ries. When I had finished, Beethoven asked me if I could play a fugue
by Bach.  I chose the Fugue in C minor from the Well-tempered
Clavichord. ``Could you transpose this fugue at once into another
key?'' Beethoven asked me.  Fortunately, I could.  After the final
chord, I looked up.  The Master's darkly glowing gaze was fixed upon
me penetratingly. Yet suddenly a benevolent smile broke up his gloomy
features, Beethoven became quite close, bent over me, laid his hand on
my head and repeatedly stroked my hair. ``Devil of a fellow'' he
whispered, ``such a young rascal!'' I suddenly plucked up courage
``May I play something of yours now?'' I asked cheekily. Beethoven
nodded with a smile.  I played the first movement of the C major
Concerto.  When I had ended, Beethoven seized both my hands, kissed me
on the forehead and said gently ``Off with you! You are a happy fellow,
for <i> you will give happiness and joy to many other people.  There
is nothing better or greater than that''</i>

<p> This event in my life has
remained my greatest pride, the palladium for my whole artistic
career.  I speak of it very rarely and only to my intimate
friends.''<hr>


Liszt lived on a pinnacle of <i>blas&eacute;ness</i> that the rest of
us cannot even imagine. (Picasso had something of the same: in his
later years he could take a party of friends out to a restaurant, and
pay off the restauranteur by doing a doodle on the bill.) And in this
story, even through the vile translation (I found this in Michael
Hamburger's wonderful book: <i>Beethoven: Letters, Journals and
Conversations</i>. Hamburger does not quote a source for this text and
I can't believe the translation is his &mdash; Hamburger is a famously skilful translator) and the obvious anecdote-ising
that Liszt has done to it (are we <i>really</i> to believe that he
only mentioned this to his intimates..?)  one can partly see why.  If
the greatest moment of your life happened to you when you were eleven &mdash; <i>Beethoven kisses the top of your head, for heavan's sake</i> &mdash;
then you really <i>don't</i> give a damn.  About <i>anything</i>.  Once the
Tsar was talking to his neighbour during a recital of Liszt's.  Liszt
pointedly stopped playing, and when the Tsar told him to continue,
Liszt replied<p> ``<i>Music herself must be silent when Nicholas
speaks</i>''.  <p>
Liszt made a lot of money, and gave a lot of it away,
had lots of ideas and squandered most of them too. One of the great
minds of the nineteenth century.<p> And what about Beethoven's remark,
italicised above?  <hr> (And little me, I'm three handshakes from
Grillparzer, and therefore <i>four</i> from these two gentlemen. AND&mdash;a recent discovery&mdash;i am two handshakes from <i>Hitler!</i>.  Eeek!)
