<h2> Bracken </h2>
  	<p>
Not understood, we move along asunder;<br>
Our paths grow wider as the seasons creep<br>
Along the years; we marvel and we wonder<br>
Why life is life, and then we fall asleep<br>
       Not understood.
  	<p>
Not understood, we gather false impressions<br>
And hug them closer as the years go by;<br>
Till virtues often seem to us transgressions;<br>
And thus men rise and fall, and live and die<br>
       Not understood.
  	<p>
Not understood!  Poor souls with stunted vision <br>
Oft measure giants with their narrow gauge;<br>
The poisoned shafts of falsehood and derision<br>
Are oft impelled 'gainst those who mould the age,<br>
       Not understood.
  	<p>
Not understood!  The secret springs of action<br>
Which lie beneath the surface and the show,<br>
Are disregarded; with self-satisfaction<br>
We judge our neighbours, and they often go<br>
       Not understood.
  	<p>
Not understood!  How trifles often change us!<br>
The thoughtless sentence and the fancied slight<br>
Destroy long years of friendship, and estrange us,<br>
And on our souls there falls a freezing blight;<br>
       Not understood.
  	<p>
Not understood!  How many breasts are aching<br>
For lack of sympathy!  Ah! day by day<br>
How many cheerless, lonely hearts are breaking!<br>
How many noble spirits pass away,<br>
       Not understood.
  	<p>
O God! that men would see a little clearer,<br>
Or judge less harshly where they cannot see!<br>
O God! that men would draw a little nearer<br>
To one another, &mdash; they'd be nearer Thee,<br>
       And understood.

<h2> Fairburn </h2>
  	<p>

Not understood. We move along asunder,<br>
The mists get thicker as our syntax goes,<br>
And in the fog we marvel and we wonder<br>
That any line we write, in verse or prose,<br>
      Is understood.
<p>
Not understood. We bury all our meanings,<br>
And dig them deeper as the years go by,<br>
Indulging thus our obscurantist leanings;<br>
And it will be no wonder if we die<br>
      Not understood.
<p>
Not understood. Despondency and madness<br>
Attend us as communications fail;<br>
We poets in our youth begin in gladness,<br>
But end in Paul's or Whitcombe's Christmas sale,<br>
      Not understood.<br>
<p>
Not understood. Our tendency is laudable,<br>
Uttering, for elevation of our thought,<br>
In thick sonorous voices, quite inaudible<br>
To the vast multitude; our books unbought,<br>
      Not understood.
<p>
Not understood. The reading mob's reaction<br>
To what it does not comprehend is slow,<br>
And gives small hope. But with self-satisfaction<br>
We judge our verses, though they often go<br>
      Not understood.
<p>
Not understood. Poor souls with stunted vision<br>
Oft measure giants by their narrow gauge;<br>
The poisoned shafts of falsehood and derision<br>
Are oft impelled 'gainst us who mould the age,<br>
      Not understood.
<p>
Not understood! How many hearts are aching<br>
For poems that are plain, and language terse!<br>
The poetry you write is epoch-making,<br>
Yet, wanting the accomplishment of verse,<br>
      Not understood.


<p>
Oh, God! that bards could be a little clearer,<br>
Or write less often when they've nowt to say;<br>
Oh, God! that bards would live a little nearer<br>
To us, and in the light of common day,<br>
      Not under Milk Wood.

I was able to find an online copy of the original, which saved me from the task of copying it by hand from the 1926 second edition of <i>A Treasury of New Zealand Verse</i> wot i had just picked up from an op shop for $1.  It's evidently not as obscure as i had expected (nor hoped). Nor is it quite as terrible as I remember it. It does have a rather good idea, but it does it to death. If you junk half of the poem it would be better.
