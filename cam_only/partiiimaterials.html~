 <FONT SIZE="+2"> A Part III <b> Reading</b> course
 on Computability and Logic in 20/21</FONT></TD> <br> <FONT SIZE="+1">
 



<hr>Gerald Sacks on
Mathematical Logic: <p> <i>``Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The
subject of Mathematical Logic splits fourfold into: Recursive
Functions, the heart of the subject; Proof Theory, which includes the
best theorem in the subject; Sets and Classes, whose romantic
appeal far outweigh their mathematical substance; and Model
Theory, whose value is its applicability to, and roots in, Algebra.''</i>
<hr>

When i reached 70 I vowed I would not lecture Part III again, but
there has been a call for a reading course in computability, and I
have agred to sponsor one.
<br>
In the coming weeks I shall draw up a reading list., and submit a formal proposal to the Faculty Office.  I intend to support this course to the extend of organising zoom meetings (of a frequency to be determined... fortnightly..?  Three-weekly..?) which will serve as examples-classes/supervisions subject to the approval of your college.  (They'd better).


<hr><b>Content</b> <br> <A HREF="partiiicomputability2020.pdf">Here</A> is the current
version of the notes from which I had been proposing to lecture this course, when i was going to lecture it before COVID.  You are
welcome to read them if you want to hit the ground running but 
you should <b>not download them</b>.  The single most
important respect in which they will change is in deletion of
material.  There is far more stuff in that folder than it is fair to specify for a reading course and I haven't yet decided which bits to leave out.  This
leaves you time to lobby me to cover (or omit) specific topics.

<hr>
<b>Background</b><br>
Much of what you might expect to find under a heading like this is in the Prolegomenon to the online notes from which I would have lectured  and which are linked above.<br>

My intended audience is people who did Set Theory and Logic <i>and</i>
 Languages and Automata at Part II.  The point, really, is that if you
 are a Cambridge student doing Part III who did Part II last year and
 who now wants to do Computability-and-Logic at Part III then you
 would have chosen those courses when you did Part II, so it is a
 reasonable assumption for me to make that you attended them.  For
 your amusement and instruction i post here my <A HREF="blog.pdf">
 blog </A> of thoughts and opinions on issues that came up in my
 supervisions of those courses.  <br> With that in mind you might like
 to look at the material on my <A HREF = "partiimaterials.html">
 Materials for Part II Mathematics page </A>.  <br> I am guilty of two
 pdfs which contain most (if not all) the basic logic and discrete
 maths that in my not-so-humble opinion should be in the backpack of
 every young mathematician about town.  One on <A
 HREF="countability.pdf"> Countability</A> and another on <A
 HREF="CUPdiscretelectures.pdf"> Discrete Mathematics</A>.  
 They were designed for 1a's but Gareth tells me they are far too advanced for 1a's. They contain elementary material that may have escaped your notice, and which&mdash;if you going to do logic&mdash;you will find agreeable.   Read through them quickly, it won't take long.

 <hr>
 I've had a look down the back of the 
sofa and i've come up with <br> <A HREF="partiii2009.pdf"> My lecture Notes from 2009 
</A> and <br> <A HREF="partiii2004.pdf"> My lecture notes from 2007 </A>;<br> <A
HREF="partiiicomputability.pdf"> My lecture notes from 2015/6</A>; <br>  <a HREF =
"comp.pdf">Henk-Jaap Wagenaar's notes from my lectures from 2015</A><br> 
<A HREF ="https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/III_L/logic.pdf">Dexter Chua's Notes of my lectures from 2016/7</A>.

<p> <hr> in 2016
Maurice Chiodo gave a couple of guest lectures on Automatic groups.  I
am putting <a HREF = "baumslag.pdf"> here</A> the Introduction to
hyperbolic and automatic groups by Baumslag, and the <a HREF =
"batty.pdf"> Notes on Hyperbolic and Automatic Groups</A> by Batty and
Papasoglu, both kindly provided by Chiodo.  I am almost certainly not going to lecture this stuff in 2021 but i'm going to leave the links up anyway. <hr>
 <hr><p> 
I am leaving  <A HREF="chapter1.pdf"> here
</A> the notes from which I lectured the first part of the course in 2017, on constructive logic; and <A HREF="partiiilogic2017.pdf"> here
</A> the notes from which I lectured the second part of the course, on model theory.



 <hr><p> 
I have linked from my <A HREF = "partiimaterials.html">
Materials for Part II Mathematics </A> page a lot of nice stuff about
computable functions, lambda calculus etc. [Scroll down to ``Languages 
and Automata''].  Some of it is a bit basic for Advanced Lifeforms such 
as your good selves, and of course the links are on that Part II page 
beco's they are aimed primarily at Part II students, but there is some 
material there (mainly the lambda calculus) which is not lectured at 
Part II, and in any case a bit of revision will do you no harm.<br>
Speaking of lambda-calculus, <A HREF="churchEquals.pdf">here</A> is
Toby Miller's nice lambda term that tests equality of Church numerals.
And I found <A HREF="http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/lamreduce/index.html"> 
this </A> rather nice lambda-calculus reduction workbench.  I hope you will find it
fun.

<hr> Among other things I shall be discussing Turing machines.  So, if
you want a foretaste of how they work, click <A HREF
="http://robotzeitgeist.com/2010/03/model-turing-machine.html"> here
</A>. (It's a shame about the voice-over but the video is dead cute.)
 <hr><p> 
Here are Frank Stephan's <A HREF ="Stephan-on-recursiontheory.pdf">Notes on computation theory</A> whence I lifted the proof of Kleene-Post.
<hr>


<hr> <A HREF ="mendelson.pdf">Here</A> is the appendix to
the first edition of Mendelson, wherein he shows how to use induction
up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> to prove the consistency of PA.


<hr> 
        <FONT SIZE="+2">Books you might want to read</FONT></TD>
<hr>
Nigel Cutland's <b>Computability</b> is worth reading and may be worth actually  <i>buying</i>.
Boolos-and-Jeffrey ditto, tho' the current edition no longer has the appendix that explains Tennenbaum's theorem. I
am putting <a HREF = "20140318103925177.pdf"> here</A> a scan of that appendix.<p>

Another book possibly worth getting is Peter Smith's <A HREF
="http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item7137024/"> G&ouml;del
book </A>.  <p> In 2016 we had
a couple of guest lectures from Maurice Chiodo (who is here for a
couple of years on a Marie Curie postdoc) on Automatic groups. Readers
might like to look at <i> Automatic Sequences, theory, applications,
generalizations</i> by Allouche and Shallit. I shall be pillaging
material from it, but I don't know how much!  You might like to be
ahead of the game, and have a look at it.  It certainly looks like fun.  
<p> I may cover some constructive arithmetic and possibly some constructive
Analysis (much harder!), with the intention that my students will look at
familar Part I material In A New Light. I have just (re)discovered the
entirely delightful <i>A Primer of Infinitesimal Analysis</i>  
 by John Bell. Worth a look, tho' perhaps not worth buying.<p> 

Wilfrid Hodges: Model Theory (either the five minute argument or the
full half-hour) is something the Logician-About-Town should have on
their shelves.<p>All the above books are Cambridge University Press
and so you can get 15% off the list price at the Cambridge University
Press bookshop in Trinity street [allegedly the oldest bookshop in the
world] by brandishing your wee blue card.  <p> Also by John Bell
(co-authored with Alan Slomson) but not published by CUP (it's from
Dover) is <b>Models and Ultraproducts</b>.  It was the first book on
model theory that I read, and I loved it.  And it's just the right
level for you lot, too.

        <FONT SIZE="+3"> Part III Essays</FONT></TD>

 <FONT SIZE="+1">



There are several Logic-related essays that I sponsor, so if you want
one come and talk to me.  Subject to confirmation by the Part III
committee the following Part III essays will be available in 2020/21:<p> 

Several are old warhorses and proposals for them exist already, and have been approved in previous years.  These are
<br>

<A HREF ="FMessay.pdf">Fraenkel-Mostowski Models</A>;<br>
<A HREF="nonstandardanalysisessay.pdf">Nonstandard Analysis</A>; and <br>
<A HREF = "NFessay.pdf">Quine's Set Theory ``NF''</A>.<p> I welcome enquiries
about them.  
<p>
Cambridge students who have read my Part II lecture notes from
2016/7 will have encountered a rudimentary form of Fraenkel-Mostowski
models in my proof of the independence of the Axiom of Choice.
I promote Fraenkel-Mostowski models partly because the final step in
<A HREF="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/"> Randall Holmes'</A>
proof of the consistency of Quine's <i>New Foundations</i> is a
[diabolical] FM construction, and it is a medium-term project of
mine to <i>really</i> understand it.  I am most of the way there,
but the one part I have not yet fully mastered is precisely that
final step. So I am always happy to talk to anyone about FM
constructions! That diabolical FM construction is of course beyond
the scope of a Part III essay [and i use the word <i>diabolical</i>
advisedly: Holmes had to sell his soul to The Auld Ane to get the
proof, and we owe it to him to ensure that his sacrifice is not in
vain] but the general idea of an FM construction is a very good topic
for a Part III essay.  If we have several takers we could have a
reading group and that could be Serious Fun.

<p> The two essays on countable ordinals and on BQOs and WQOs were
tackled in 2019/20 and are accordingly not available in 20/21.
<p> I am trying to get off the ground an essay on
<A HREF = "interpretations.pdf">Synonymy</A>; the proposal linked
here is formatted like an official proposal but it is as yet only
in draught form.   If you like the look of it, and think you might
want to do it, by all means contact me and i shall work it up into
a proposal acceptable to the committee.
<hr>
Part III students should remember that if the essay they
want to write is not listed, it is entirely in order for them to ask
for someone to set it.  That is how i ended up setting the essay on
Nonstandard Analysis!  Try your luck.
<!--With their permission I am putting links to three Part III essays on 
Fraenkel-Mostowski models by the 2012/3 cohort:<p>
<A HREF = "http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/millwood-FM-essay-2013.pdf"> Ben Millwood's essay</A>. This 
essay concentrates on the application of FM models to alpha-conversion in lambda calculus.
<br>
<A HREF = "http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/newstead-FM-essay-2013.pdf"> Clive Newstead's essay</A>.<br>

<A HREF = "http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/yuan-yuan-FM-essay2013.pdf"> Yuan Yuan Zheng's essay </A>.<br>
tho' i can see that i shall have to take those links down....  I shall do that as soon as i learn the html command for commenting stuff out.-->
