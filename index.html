Nowadays I am a visiting professor at Mathematics at the <a href="https://sms.wgtn.ac.nz/Main/Visitors">
Victoria University of Wellington</a>. <p>

From october 2016 to september 2022 I was the resident bye-fellow in Pure
Mathematics in <a href="http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/">Queens',</a>
College Cambridge (where I was also Director of Studies for Part III and am now an <i>Emeritus Fellow</i>—tho' i haven't yet worked out what that involves);
now that I have reached retirement age my status as an <i>affiliated
lecturer</i> in the department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical
Statistics in Cambridge has lapsed; I am a Life Associate of <a href="http://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/">Clare Hall,</a> Cambridge, and I
am also a Senior member of <a href="http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/">St. Edmunds,</a>.<br> Outside
Cambridge my affiliations are: Adjunct Senior Fellow in the Philosophy
department at the <a href="http://www.phil.canterbury.ac.nz/">University of Canterbury at
Christchurch</a>; Visiting Lecturer at <a href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/"> Queen Mary Westfield; </a> External
Researcher of the <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/">
Auckland Centre for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer
Science</a> in <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/twizelorcs2.jpg"> New Zealand</a>, and a
Fellow of the <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/"> Center for
Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh</a>.

When I was
in residence there I stayed—as many fellows do—in <a href="http://www.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/phisci/Gallery/hempel.html"> Carl
Hempel</a>'s flat. The Pittsburgh Center [<i>sic</i>] also has <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/tednbarbara.jpg"> conferences</a>. (Pittsburgh has many attractions
beyond its six (!) universities: serious weather, a wonderful
orchestra, opera houses, rivers, cable cars, the best chips in America
(at the <a href="http://pittsburgh.citysearch.com/profile/8608800">
Original Hot Dog</a>. Be sure to ask for a <b>small</b> portion),
steel mills, lots of history (much of it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Strike"> sad</a>), and, last
but not least, an airport called—wait for it—``Tom
Foerster International Airport''!  (The correct explanation for this
spelling mistake is surely the one found by <a href="http://www.hum.au.dk/engelsk/engsv"> Sten Vikner </a> who pointed out
that they must have misplaced my middle initial.)

I organised the <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/NFUK.html"> 70th anniversary NF meeting</a> (``NFUK'') in Cambridge at the end of May 2007. <br>

I am on the Comité de Redaction of the Belgian <a href="http://www.lofs.ucl.ac.be/cnrl"> Centre National de
Recherches de Logique</a>; <br> I am a ``correspondent étranger" of 
 <a href="http://www.lofs.ucl.ac.be/cnrl/loganalyse/"> Logique et Analyse</a>;<br>
I was the Cambridge horn (in fact the <i>Principal Researcher(!)</i>) of 
the (currently slumbering) three-horned beast that is  Cameleon.  <br> I was Conference
Director  for the (now dormant) St Luke's Institute, in which
capacity I organised <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/BILAP.html"> BILAP</a> (Buddhism in
Logic and Analytic Philosophy) which held its inaugural meeting in
Cambridge in November 2005, and the <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/LandR.html"> Logic and
Rhetoric</a> conference held in Cambridge on the last weekend of
October 2006. <br> I was on the  DPMMS Quiz team
which mercilessly crushed all opposition to be the winners in the 
800th anniversary Quiz contest.  At the 800th anniversary garden
party we went on to murder a team of alumni. I used to have a link 
to footage of that event, but that footage was never for the 
squeamish and has now been made unavailable!

I spent summer 2014 <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/empirestrikesback.jpg">flying the flag in
the Idaho Marches</a> in <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/tf-and-evil-Boise20140827.jpg">

I am a logician: i study <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/SDC13935.JPG"> Logic </a>.
I work on Set Theory, Type Theory, BQO theory, Philosophy of Mathematics and Philosophy of Mind.  I developed
this last interest when I was a music+philosophy student and it led me
into  <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/CNS-Cambridge-2011-Poster_ClareKillikelly.jpg">
Neurophysiology</a> (yes, that is me in the picture, but no logicians were harmed in the execution of this experiment)
: until relatively recently I was a paid-up member of the <a href="http://ansuk.org/"> Electro-Physiological
Technologists Association</a>.  I had to give up
my part-time post at Addenbrooke's doing EEGs to take up my Pittsburgh
Fellowship.  The
combination of an interest in Philosophy of Mind and a training in
logic has given me an abiding interest in the logic of virtual
(theoretical) entities. (Having the part of the Cheshire Cat in the
school production of Alice about the time the above photograph was
taken probably played a part too). Indeed when the <a href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/SS:DP::DEPTLOGIC,AD,HOMEP,LPS"> Logic and
Philosophy of Science department at the University of California at
Irvine </a> were so kind as to invite me to spend three months with
them I took the opportunity to write a book about it, called <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/baby2.html">Reasoning about Theoretical Entities</a>.  Not
surprisingly, given my exposure to the Life Sciences and my interest
in reasoning about theoretical entities, I have an interest in
Philosophy of Biology.  Most of my publications concern Quine's set theory <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/nf.html"> NF</a>,
for which an introduction for a general audience can be found <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/AMM.ps"> here</a> (it was a 60th anniversary retrospective article
for the American Mathematical Monthly).<hr>

For a while i have been trying to interest people in the constructions discussed
in my <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/strZF.ps"> AMS Baltimore meeting article</a>.
<a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/site2002/People/dang_hv.html"> Dang Vu</a> 
wrote a <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/dangthesis.pdf"> Ph.D. thesis</a> on this subject 
which he has kindly allowed me to link from here..  My hope was that these 
constructions would lead to a proof of Con(NF). Even tho'
they have been pipped at the post (see below) the methods used in this paper are
related to those used in Randall's proof, and it could be a good place 
to start reading.  
<br>


 
The world of NF studies is being turned upside-down by the news
that NF has been proved consistent.  Unfortunately I am no longer able 
to supervise Ph.D. students in Cambridge, There is a plan to get some money 
 together for two (or perhaps more) Ph.D. students to follow up Randall 
 Holmes' consistency proof for NF working under me and Noam Greenberg at 
 Vic (= Victoria University of Wellington) and  to this end I provide a  
 <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/thesistopics.pdf"> 
  discussion of some suitable thesis topics</a>.  (Actually not all the topics in there are NF topics...
there are some topics in philosophy of mathematics that i'd be happy to 
supervise too.)<br> 
In addition to the obvious NZ delights we all know about (hobbits behind every sofa etc etc)
New Zealand is increasingly a destination for people seeking  places with stable democratic government.  Get in early(!)

<a name="ancestry"><strong></strong></a><strong><font size="+2">Ancestry</font></strong> 
  <br> My mother came from <a href="http://www.basel.ch/de/basel/home"> Basel</a>, the city that Holbein made his home, that produced
Leonhard Euler, and has been home to the Bernoulli family
since they were expelled by the Reyes Catolicos (isn't that enough for
a small town???).  We know about the mathematicians of course, (and
even the tennis players: Roger Federer is a Basler) but it has also
produced some wonderful painters—and not just Holbein. Sadly the
creator of this little <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/pipe.jpg">gem</a> in the
Eulerstrasse (yes, it's the same Euler) did not sign his work and his
(her?) identity was not recorded for posterity.  I tell everyone I am
a fourth-generation academic, and this is because of her (my mother's) 
grandfather <a href="http://retro.seals.ch/digbib/view;jsessionid=C10CBDAA3F365B73580F1FAEBF65AA38?rid=bsn-002:1928:53::237&amp;id=browse&amp;id2=browse1&amp;id3="> 
Otto Billeter Snr</a> who was a fairly well-known chemist (he discovered the 
rearrangement of allyl thiocyanate to allyl <i>iso</i>thiocyanate) 
from whom i inherited through her not only some genes for doing 
chemistry but also a  <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/billeter.html"> dressing-gown</a>.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Frauenfelder"> Hans Frauenfelder</a> was his great-nephew. 
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Vouga"> Jean-Pierre Vouga</a> was his grandson. 

My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Wilson_Forster"> father,</a> too,  is in Wikipædia (as are his father and grandfather) but the pick of the Wikipædia entries on my ancestors is probably 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Freke_(surgeon)">John Freke</a>.  Sadly  
I get only about 0.4% of my genes from him—which is a pity, 'cos he was an FRS!


<p>
But in any case it's intellectual ancestry one worries about. 

I had two DoktorVater: <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/adrian.jpg">Adrian Mathias</a> in Cambridge, and 
<a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/mauricepiccie.ps"> Maurice Boffa</a>  
in Brussels. Sadly, Boffa died in 2001: it is a terrible loss.   
<a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/sarahf.html"> Here</a> are two group pictures, with three of his
Ph.D. students. 
My
other DoktorVater, <a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/">
Adrian Mathias</a>, is still very much alive—for the moment at
least: he does live uncomfortably near an active volcano!)  
According to the <a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=77585">
Mathematics Genealogy Project </a> I am descended (thru' Mathias) 
from Fichte, Hegel, Kant and Leibniz!!   Thru' Boffa I am descended from Poincaré!!



</p><p> Like
Everyone Who Is Anyone in Silicon Fen I worked (briefly) for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Sinclair"> Clive Sinclair</a>,  in my case in 
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Radionics">
Sinclair Radionics</a> days.  (He was a neighbour of my parents).  My Erdős




number is 3: Forster-Truss-Shelah-Erdős ; (and Erdős  many years
ago described me as ``a very strange young man''!). But there are
other metrics. My Trotsky number is 3 (I shared an office with a  colleague <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~corsi/">
(Giovanna Corsi)</a> who shared an office with a  colleague <a href="http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/heijen/"> 
(Jean van Heijenoort)</a> who was Trotsky's bodyguard); my Beethoven
number is 4, since I have shaken hands with a man who shook hands with
a man who shook hands with Grillparzer, who shook hands with
Beethoven, Liszt...well—everyone!  I once played Garcia Lorca's
piano. I used to play chess with a woman who had been Tolstoy's
next-door neighbour, and had been taught by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Alekhine">Alekhine</a>
. When an infant she had been dandled on Tchaikovsky's knee. Facebook is forever telling me i should 
(``friend suggestion'') befriend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinda_Ardern">Jacinda Ardern</a>.  (We have a facebook friend in common). If you are a Canadian you
may be impressed by the fact that I once had my portrait painted by <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/barker.jpg"> Barker Fairley</a>
 (he's the one with the pipe in
this group picture of the group of seven); apparently I am the only
person other than Wittgenstein to have given a course of lectures in
Cambridge gazetted under the title `Philosophy' (that is a distinction 
that Wittgenstein can hardly have forseen); my Ph.D. Thesis  
 title <a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/223940"> "N.F." </a><a>
is the shortest on record; as far as I know I am the only
person to have a Cambridge Ph.D. in mathematics without having done
any undergraduate mathematics; finally I must surely be the only Logic
Ph.D. anywhere in the world who is also licenced to drive an EEG machine. 
[tho' this is less remarkable than the double <i>coup</i> by my Otago colleague
</a><a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/bioethics/people/academic/profile/index.html?id=662">  Grant Gillett </a> who had two articles accepted in the one year...one for <a href="http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/"> MIND </a> and the other for <a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/BRAIN"> BRAIN</a>.]  My remaining distinguishing features are of less
interest. Born in the oldest house in Cambridge? And a haunted one at
that? (It's the <a href="https://democracy.cambridge.gov.uk/Data/Property%20and%20Administration%20Sub%20Committee/20020319/Agenda/Item%207%20-%20ABBEY%20HOUSE%20-%20app%201.pdf">
Abbey House</a>). It
had been a gift from the first Baron Fairhaven to the Cambridge City Council who then
divided it into flats and let them out—so should I ever want to go
into politics I can always say I was born in council house! and I was
delivered by <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-dr-alice-roughton-1588899.html"> Alice
Roughton</a>). The only person to have been at school with both the
erstwhile Home Secretary (Charles Clarke) and the Queen's (erstwhile) 
private secretary (Robin Janvrin)?  (Not to mention the—sadly—thoroughly unmemorable  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake"> 
Nick Drake  </a> who was in my Russian class at Marlborough.  We were taught by the entirely stellar <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/rwwp.jpg"> Richard Pollock, who went on to be Mrs Thatcher's personal interpreter in her conversations with Gorbachev)</a>.  The 
tabloids are not beating a path to my door. I do not—yet—have a 
theorem named after me, (nor even an
airport, see above) tho' there is a lifeform bearing my name: not a 
child—sadly—but a <i>midge</i>
called <a href="https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/midge.html"> Telnatogeton Forsteri</a>.  This
lives only in New Zealand—there is a type specimen in my desk drawer in
Cambridge but it's definitely dead. This lifeform was discovered by my
friend <a href="http://osms.otago.ac.nz/physiology/staff/leader.html"> John Leader</a>.  If you wish to name an invertebrate or a theorem—or even an airport—after me, feel free.

Here, for old times' sake, is the console of the first machine i ever wrote code for.  My former student <a href="http://nickbenton.name/">Nick Benton </a> says that assembly language is the sound of old men crying into their beer, but i'm not ashamed.
