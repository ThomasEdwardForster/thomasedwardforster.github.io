<p>  It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the
      working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of
      any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red
      flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every
      wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the
      initials of the revolutionary parties; almost every church had
      been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were
      being systematically demolished by gangs of workmen. Every shop
      and cafe had an inscription saying that it had been
      collectivised; even the bootblacks had been collectivised and
      their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers
      looked you in the face and treated you as an equal... There were
      no private motor-cars, they had all been commandeered, and all
      the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted
      red and black... Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of
      the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and fro,
      the loudspeakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and
      far into the night. And it was the aspect of the crowds that was
      the queerest thing of all. In outward appearance it was a town
      in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to
      exist... Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes,
      or blue overalls, or some variant of the militia uniform.<i> All
      this was queer and moving. There was much in it that I did not
      understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I
      recognised it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting
      for. </i>

Also I believed that things were as they appeared, that
      this was really a workers' state and that the entire bourgeoisie
      had either fled, been killed, or voluntarily come over to the
      workers' side; I did not realise that great numbers of
      well-to-do bourgeois were simply lying low and disguising
      themselves as proletarians for the time being

Orwell.  An immensely attractive writer.  The italics above are mine:
i treasure this passage .. the humility, the generosity of spirit...
<br>However i was made to read <i>1984</i> when i was an
impressionable adolescent, and it <i>completely</i> freaked me
out. There is no escape, no happy ending. No nothing.  To this day i
have not been able to re-read it.<hr>
