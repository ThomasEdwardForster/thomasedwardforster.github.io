<hr><strong>Research Interests</strong> </p>
<p>


My research interests lie in that area where Mathematics and Philosophy
meet.  Is there a difference between the two?  Perhaps not: Wilfrid Hodges describes
them both as part of the theory of the <i> a priori</i>.  Placing
myself in the middle of the spectrum in this way is perhaps a bit
misleading, since it suggests that I am <i>un</i>interested in lots of
topics in which I am in fact <i>exceedingly</i> interested: logic crops up
wherever one is trying to explain one concept in terms of another, or
merely in seeing how they fit together---wherever one is doing Good Old
Conceptual Analysis, in fact.  Of course I also have philosophical interests
not obviously connected to Logic, for example:
<A HREF ="www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/LandR.html"> Rhetoric </A>
and
<A HREF ="www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/BILAP.html">Buddhism</A>  
(the links are to home pages of conferences I have organised). Nowadays a lot of
philosophically interesting work is being done in Computer Science
departments, particularly in the areas of Philosophy of Language and
Philosophy of Mathematics.

<p> I have always been fascinated by reductionist strategies in
Philosophy.  This is not so much because I expect them to succeed, but
because the failures are likely to bring us important news about 
irreducible ontological commitment.  This has driven
much of my interest in Philosophy of Mathematics, Philosophy of Mind
and Philosophy of Biology.<p> My Ph.D. was on Quine's <i> New
Foundations</i> and I continue to work on it. Although there is a
significant penumbra of thoughtful bystanders with a passing interest
in NF, the scholars engaged in <i>active</i> research into it can be counted
on the fingers of one hand.  The People Of The Penumbra are basically
holding fire until someone proves the consistency of NF relative to a
ZF-style system.  The wait is likely to be a long one.  Meanwhile the
search by the insiders continues.

<p>Another current research project is to try to understand the strong
typing of Mathematics (``Is 3 a member of 5?" is clearly a daft
question) and connect it to the crude but effective type systems that
arise from Russell-and-Whitehead <i> Principia Mathematica</i> and to
the typing systems (``Category distinctions") of the Logical
Positivists (``This stone is thinking about Vienna").  The endogenous
typing system of Mathematics seems to have an operationalist
basis---having members is not the kind of thing numbers <i>do</i>.
There seems also to be an operationalist current of thinking behind 
category theory, and certainly in its applications in Theoretical 
Computer Science.  It would be good to see what role operationalist 
thinking can play in uniting the two sources of typing intuition.
An early sample of my thoughts on this project is in <i> Implementing
Mathematical Objects in Set Theory,</i> in <i> Logique et Analyse</i> <b>50</b> No.197 (2007)

<p>

As a logician I have an inevitable interest in Philosophy of Language.
(Max Cresswell said to me ``The difference between a logician and a
mathematician is that a logician understands the use-mention
distinction"; Adrian Mathias - my DoktorVater - said ``A logician is
someone who thinks that a formula is a mathematical object".)  How does
the syntax that is available to us constrain what we can say? Does
syntax create spurious logical or mathematical truths?  For example: might 
not the fact that A & B is logically equivalent to B & A be merely an
artefect of the fact that our notation is linear, and that therefore 
one of `A' and `B' has to precede the other?  Better Philosophers than 
I (Ramsey and  Quine, to name but two) have written about this, and an essay 
(``De-linearising Ehrenfeucht-Mostowski") in which I develop this idea
is under submission to the <i> Review of Symbolic Logic</i>.

<p><a name="Biography"><strong></strong></a><strong>Biography</strong></p>

I went to university
(UEA!) intending to study History, but when I was doing prelims (in those
days all students in the school of social studies (= Economic History,
Economics, Philosophy and Sociology) did the same preliminary course
in the first two terms) we were made to do Elementary Logic and made to read
Quine: <i> From a Logical Point of View</i>! I abandoned History forthwith,
and I managed to persuade the senate that I could choose History of Music as
my minor subject (everybody had to have a minor). History of Music was in
the School of Fine Arts, then in its first year.  Thus I became a
founder student of Fine Arts at UEA.  I stayed on at UEA to do an
M.A. and then emigrated to New Zealand.  My eye was caught by an ad in the local 
paper for the post of trainee EEG (Electroencephalography) technician.  I had a 
vague idea about EEGs because Central State Materialism was all the rage in 
those days, and `EEG' was a convenient shorthand for the claim that 
mental states and brain-states were the same thing. In 1972 returned to 
Cambridge (my birthplace) to do a Ph.D. in Mathematics.  My topic 
was Quine's <i> New Foundations</i> which I had encountered in <i> 
From a Logical Point of View</i> when an undergraduate at UEA.  I
spent some years (mostly in New Zealand) working as an EEG technician
and as a programmer, but also studying composition (at the Auckland
conservatorium) till I resumed an academic career in the early 80's -
in the first instance as a post-doc in the Computer Laboratory in
Cambridge on a project involving natural language processing and
automated theorem proving.  I still practice as an EEG technician
occasionally but in recent years I have generally divided my time
between Cambridge (where I am an affiliated lecturer in DPMMS [the
Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics] and the
Director of Studies in Computer Science at Clare Hall) and New Zealand
where I estivate and teach logic.  I have been a Reader (part-time) in
the Philosophy Department at UEA since 2008/9.  It is a pleasure to return to my roots!<br><hr>

I do a lot of teaching and I have always enjoyed it.  Nevertheless I 
have in recent years (since being a post-doc, that is) had two stints 
as a pure research animal, one in UC Irvine (2001) and another (in 2003) at the 
Centre for Philosophy of Science in Pittsburgh.  The result of all this 
leisure was the book <A HREF = "www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/baby2.html"> 
Reasoning about Theoretical Entities</A>.   
However I also derive a great deal of my creative impulse from teaching, 
since the need to explain things to students drags up from one's 
subconscious things one did not know that one knew.  (``How do I know 
what I think until I hear what I say?" Wittgenstein is supposed to 
have asked) and certainly my two most recent books <i> An introduction 
to the axioms of set theory</i> and
<i> Logic, Induction and Sets</i> arose from the experience of
explaining that material to students.<hr>
