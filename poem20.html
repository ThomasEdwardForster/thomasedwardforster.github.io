<br>
There is no future, there is no more past
<br>
No roots nor fruits, but momentary flowers, 
<br>
Lie still, only lie still and night will last
<br>
Silent and dark, not for a space of hours, 
<br>
But everlastingly. Let me forget
<br>
All but your perfume, every night but this. 
<br>
The shame, the fruitless weeping, the regret.
<br>
Only lie still: this faint and quiet bliss
<br>
Shall flower upon the brink of sleep and spread
<br>
Till there is nothing left but you and I
<br>
Clasped in a timeless silence.  But like one
<br>
Who, doomed to die, at morning will be dead,
<br>
I know, though night seem dateless, that the sky
<br>
must brighten soon before tomorrow's sun.

  Aldous Huxley <hr> My friend Tony Egan showed me this poem years ago.  In
striking contrast to poem 18 (The Tyger) this sonnet cries out to be
set to music. The phrases `silent and dark', `only lie still', `nor
roots nor fruits', `let me forget' all suggest to me a common semitone
figure moving between a minor subdominant and a dominant.  It
gradually goes away with the dawn. <p>

  I started 45 years ago and one day i'll finish.
