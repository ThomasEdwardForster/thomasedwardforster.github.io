<hr>
That which is too silly to be said may nevertheless be sung
<hr>

Wikip&aelig;dia seems to think it is Voltaire; <i>I</i> tho'rt it was Ernest
Newman, but <i>anyway</i><br> I once asked my friend Ralph Hawtrey if he
knew who said it and he tho'rt for a moment <br> and replied:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``I <i>don't</i> know who said it, actually, but
what I
 <i> do</i> know is that anything that is too <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silly to be sung in your own language can always be sung in
someone else's.'' <p> What could he possibly have had in mind, one wonders?
