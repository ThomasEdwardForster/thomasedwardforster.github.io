<p>

In modern thought, if not in fact,<br>
nothing <i>is</i> which does not <i>act</i>.<br>
Thus, that is counted science which<br>
describes the <i>scratch</i> but not the <i>itch</i>.

...but shown me by my old friend Tony Egan. 

The only real trouble with this little ditty is that the <i>ablaut</i>
sequence in the last line is the wrong way round: the stressed `a'
syllable should come <i>after</i> the stressed `i' syllable.  That 
way it would sound much better. Think of Morgenstern, <i> 

<A HREF ="https://www.textlog.de/17374.html"> Das Gro&szlig;e Lalula</i></A>
and its line <i>Bifzi, bafzi,...</i>.  To have the vowels in the  other order would be wrong.  The two words are the present tense and preterite forms of a strong verb.
The quatrain should be rewritten so that the rhyme in lines 3 and
4 is `scratch'.

<p>
Go on&mdash;call me a pedant.  I admit it.
