<p>


    Out of the night that covers me, <br>
    Black as the pit from pole to pole, <br>
    I thank whatever gods may be <br>
    For my unconquerable soul. <br>
<p>
    In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>
    I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br>
    Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>
    My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br>
<p>

    Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br>
    Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br>
    And yet the menace of the years <br>
    Finds and shall find me unafraid. <br>
<p>
    It matters not how strait the gate, <br>
    How charged with punishments the scroll, <br>
    I am the master of my fate: <br>
    I am the captain of my soul. <br>

William Ernest Henley 
<hr> 
This was a favourite of my mother's... In fact it's the only 
poem in English I can remember her quoting.<br>  I think William 
Ernest Henley had a slightly harder life than she did, if 
Wikip√¶dia is to be believed.<br>   But all of us sometimes need
to talk up our own courage.
<p>
I derive a certain amount of amusement from the efforts made by some 
Christians to annex this poem.<br>  It is quite striking that 
a deeply felt poem such as this&mdash;<i>by a Victorian Englishman 
 </i> dammit&mdash;should <br> be so entirely free of any of the
Christian apparatus that was so fashionable at the time.  Gods 
there may <br> be, but they don't seem to be there for Mr Henley 
when he might need them.
