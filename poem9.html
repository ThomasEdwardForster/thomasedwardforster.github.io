Anon

<hr> (Americans might need to be told that Oz is not the kingdom
invented by Frank Baum but <i>Australia</i>.) Anon's work appeared
on various walls in Wellington in about 1983.  I always rather liked
"Six impossible things&mdash;collect the set".  (I assume this is a
reference to <i>Through the Looking-Glass and what Alice found
there</i>.) However his (or was it her?) greatest triumph appeared
soon after Wellington (Well, Lower Hutt) police had bungled a dawn
raid and in the confusion in the dark shot dead the householder, a
young father called Paul Chase&mdash;whereupon the Prime Minister shot his
mouth off with some characteristically unbelievably tactless remark
about how he'd brought it on himself etc. etc.  The very same week
Chuck and Di arrive in Wellington with the infant Prince
William. Goo-goo isn't he gorgeous. Anon's graffito said ``PM shoots
in dark: kills royal baby''.  What a genius.  Where is (s)he now??
