I treasure this remark.  Try as I can, I have been unable to find
a source for it on the web.  I thought it was Russell, but my
friend Hilary says it sounds as if it could be Nietzsche.  It does
indeed.  But then it could be anyone with an ounce of integrity
really, couldn't it?  If you know who it is, please write and tell me.
<p>

Actually, it occurs to me that it could be one of the existentialists,
beco's Pascal's Wager is probably the <i>perfect</i> example of Bad Faith.
<p>While we're about it, it's not only cowardly and wicked (and unforgivably frivolous)  it must
surely also be <i>pointless</i>.  No God worth believing in would
stand for this kind of nonsense for the twinkling of an eye, as they
say in the Old Testament; you can't fool the likes of <i>him</i>: he
would <i>know</i> you were taking the piss.
