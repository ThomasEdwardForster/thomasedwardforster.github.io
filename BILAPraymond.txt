Yes, except for preferring Word Perfect for my personal uses, Gates owns me. Here's the abstract:
 

Ray Martin, "Ironic Engagement"

ABSTRACT

Parfitian Reductionists claim that a person, or self, just consists in the existence of a brain, a body, and a series of interrelated physical and psychological events. Buddhist Reductionists may go further. It is a consequence of either sort of Reductionism that persons (and selves) are fictional entities. But what then becomes of future-oriented egoistic concern, including prudence? Critics have claimed that if Reductionism were true, then egoistic concern would go by the boards, resulting in a kind of nihilism. Reductionists have responded by claiming that egoistic concern can be justified on moral grounds. I question this strategy for defending Reductionism. In addition, presumably the sort of egoistic concern that a Buddhist Reductionist at least, and perhaps also a Parfitian Reductionist, would think can be justified on moral grounds would have to be one that is purged of attachment to the self that leads to suffering. For most of us, this is not an option that we can simply choose. Nor is it clear what sort of egoistic concern that would be if it were available. Mark Siderits has suggested recently that what's called for is an ironic engagement with our future selves. I explore this suggestion.

Ray
