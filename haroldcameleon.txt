The notes are more or less finished now. I might do a bit of
tinkering, but there won't be any sbstantial changes.

Yes, that sound Ok. When I start I will backtrack a little, so it
won't matter if you don't do everything you plan to.

Here is a title and abstract.

   The topological content of Monotone Bar Induction and the Fan
   Principle

                Harold Simmons   University of Manchester

   Both MBI and FP are techniques used in some variant of constructive
   mathematics. They also have some interest for proper
   mathematics. They are often only aplied only to the Baire tree and
   the Cantor tree, respectively, but in a suitable form can be applied
   to any tree. In the classical context they are choice principles
   related to Dependent Choice. The two principles are not equivalent
   and the difference can be measure using a tological ranking
   technique.

   I will describe some of the older work on the techniques, and then
   throw in a new observation.

We will probably travel down by train on Tuesday 28th, so I will be
there for your talks. I don't yet know whether to come back on the
Sunday or the Monday. I'm investigating the possiblities.

PS  Some seems to have gone wrong with my pine system, so I will send
two version of this: one by pine and one by old fashioned mail.
