<FONT SIZE="+1"> The notes from which I shall lecture this course are
to be found <A HREF = "CSlogiccourse.pdf"> here</A>.  They are not
guaranteed to be bug-free: the file represents work-in-progress.  I am
not certain at this stage how much of the material in it will actually
be covered, and there is no suggestion that possession of hard copy of
it is a substitute for attending the course and taking notes!
Nevertheless I am expecting it to be very useful to students following
this course.<br>

 <A HREF = "CSLnonce.pdf"> Here</A> is the discussion of the truth-functional arrow that I promised on my lecture on th 4/x.

This is, as the lab's page says, a course in Logic.  Nevertheless
there are two areas that are not covered at all.  One is set theory,
and the other is computability theory, the theory of computable
functions.  They were not in the original specification for this
course, but - more to the point - there is a set theory course for the
CS M.Phil. course that is lectured in Lent term by Professor Winskel,
and there is a Part III Maths course in computable functions lectured
by me, also in Lent.  There is no administrative structure for CS
M.Phil. students to be examined on it, but it may well be suitable for
them.

<A HREF = "oldtriposquestions.pdf> Here </A> are four model questions for the
Part II Mathematics logic course, which you might like to try.
