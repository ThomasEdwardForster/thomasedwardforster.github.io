The Abhidhamma Model of Consicousness AM_0

Henk Barendregt

Abstract
Based on personal experience with vipassana meditation and theoretical
studies under respectively Thai and Burmese teachers an interpretation of
part of the Abhidhamma will be given. The Abhidhamma is considered as a
form of phenomenological psychology, obtained as side effect of meditation
used as trained introspection. The Abhidhamma describes in a cryptic way
an intricate model of consciousness on three levels. The first level 
consists
of a discrete, serial stream of `atoms of awareness' called cetas.
Secondly, a linear sequence of cetas may form a `molecule', called vithi,
being a cognitive-emotional conscious unit. Finally, each ceta has a
substructure of conscious mental factors (comparable to `elementary 
particles'),
called cetasikas, acting in parallel. An important part of the 
Abhidhamma is the
Patthana, that describes the mechanism of conditioning by `kamma'
between these cetasikas and cetas. A short sketch of the Abhidhamma
model will be given, thereby reflecting the author's present
understanding and non-understanding. Through the model a natural
interpretation will be given of notions like `neurosis', `psychosis'
and also various coping mechanisms.  Thereafter the model is used to
describe the process of mental purification by the practice of
mindfulness towards insight. The effects of mindfulness in
psychotherapy fit in this explanation. Finally some methodological
considerations and views on the compatibility of the Abhidhamma with
neurophysiology are discussed.
