We meet 14:30 - 16:00 in MR 15 on mondays.<br>
We are going to start by reading <i>Jech: The Axiom of Choice</i><p>

<A HREF ="FMreadinglist.pdf">  Here </A> are my 
``write-it-down-to-get-it-straight-in-your-own-mind'' notes on FM methods.   
They tail off a bit in the second half, since they contain a correspondence 
in which Jamie Gabbay attempts personfully to explain his stuff to me.   
So it contains lots of daft questions!
At the <i>very</i> end however, is a bibliography.  So once your reading 
takes you to something that is opaque, skip forward!<p>



 

<A HREF ="FMSModels.pdf ">  Here </A> is the scanned bit of Felgner.
<br>
<A HREF ="FMModelsTruss.pdf">  Here </A> is the scanned bit of Truss.
