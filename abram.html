So Abram rose, and clave the wood, and went,<br>
And took the fire with him, and a knife.<br>
And as they sojourned both of them together,<br>
Isaac the first-born spake and said, ``My Father,<br>
Behold the preparations, fire and iron,<br>
But where the lamb for this burnt-offering?''<br>
Then Abram bound the youth with belts and straps,<br>
and builded parapets and trenches there,<br>
And stretch√®d forth the knife to slay his son.<br>
When lo! an angel called him out of heaven,<br>
Saying, ``Lay not thy hand upon the lad,<br>
Neither do anything to him. Behold&mdash;!<br>
A ram, caught in a thicket by its horns;<br>
<i>Offer the Ram of Pride instead!!''</i><p>
But the old man would not so, and slew his son,<br>
<i>And</i> half the seed of Europe, one by one.

I worry often that the full force of this poem is lost on generations
younger than mine, who were <i>not</i> brought up on the Authorised
version of the Bible the way I was, and do <i>not</i> know the texts
that it contains, <i>no longer</i> have our sure-footed control of its
language, and therefore can<i>not</i> feel the cold fury that hisses
forth from every line of this poem that is written in that language
and that lives off those texts.  God knows, the original readers of
this poem would have felt it clearly enough.  Benjamin Britten
certainly did, for one.  And you don't have to be a believer.  <br>
I like, too, the way his appropriation of the finger-wagging tone that 
this language always seems to our ears to have enables him to drive 
home an&mdash;entirely serious&mdash;message that is quite different from those 
usually conveyed in that language.  <p> I do remember my
friend Ismay Barwell saying that when, as a child, she encountered the
story of Abraham being prepared to sacrifice Isaac it struck her as so
completely, entirely and unquestionably bonkers&mdash;what kind of parent
would so much as <i>consider</i> sacrificing their child, after all?&mdash;that it totally and permanently destroyed any trust she might ever
otherwise have had in the other messages that might have been
available from the body of texts whence that appalling narrative
came.  For my part i don't remember being that appalled.  I think i just
supposed that the adult world was a bizarre place and it would all
become clear In Due Course.  But then she was a firstborn and had much
more confidence in her own judgement than i, a lastborn, would have.
And when i did eventually learn the adult world's explanation, you
know, submission to God's will and so on, i had by then acquired some 
confidence in my own judgement and i just thought [family show or no] 
well, actually, <i>bollocks</i>, sorry.... <p>

If this poem does not chill your blood and bring tears
of rage to your eyes then you have been deprived of something, have
lost part of your heritage.  Rage, rage against the dying of the
light.

I think this poem has to be read aloud, with special attention to line 
8, which has to be read as <i>something censored that has somehow broken 
through,</i> a 20th century  irruption into the reassuring world of the 
Authorised version.   Owen is quite right to make only limited use of this 
device, since the poem relies on the 16th century language to get past 
our defences.

I confess to having [slightly] doctored the text, particularly the punctuation.
