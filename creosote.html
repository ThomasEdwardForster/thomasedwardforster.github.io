Wikipedia has quite a good article about Mr Creosote. You could start
with that, and of course the <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aczPDGC3f8U."> youtube clip, </A>

and 
<A HREF="http://montypython.50webs.com/scripts/Meaning_of_Life/10.htm"> the text</A>.

Neither of these seem to explain why our eponymous hero bears the name
he does, and i for one would like to know.  I don't know whom to ask:
Pythons are falling off their perches like Beatles.  Soon nobody who
can remember the 70s will be left.  (If you can remember it, you weren't
there.. or was that the 60's..? I can't remember) <hr>

I feel quite pleased with myself for having known <i>immediately</i>
&mdash; when i first saw this sketch &mdash; and as soon as it began &mdash;
that Mr Creosote would eat too much and explode.  [I don't know how i knew
it but i did. With Python i always had the feeling &mdash; which  of course
could have been entirely misplaced &mdash; that i always knew what they were
trying to do, even tho' i couldn't have put it into words &mdash; and in any
case much of the time it didn't work anyway.]
<p> The thing
that seems important to me, but which no-one else seems to have
noticed, is that Mr Creosote is a <i>tragedy</i>.  It is, i think, the
shortest tragedy there is.  A tragedy?!  Yes, Mr Creosote is destroyed
by his failings.  It's inevitable, and you know from the outset that
it is inevitable, and that's part of why it is a tragedy.  <p> It has
to be admitted that he is offered a way out: <p>

MAITRE D: And finally, monsieur, a wafer-thin mint.  <br>
MR. CREOSOTE: Nah.  <br> MAITRE D: Oh, sir, it's only a tiny, little,
thin one.  <br> MR. CREOSOTE: No. Fuck off. I'm full.  <br> MAITRE D:
Oh, sir. Hmm?  <br> MR. CREOSOTE: [groan] <br> MAITRE D: It's only
wafer thin.  <br> MR. CREOSOTE: Look. I couldn't eat another
thing. I'm absolutely stuffed. Bugger off.  <br> MAITRE D: Oh, sir,
just &mdash; just one.  <br> MR. CREOSOTE: [groaning] All right. Just
one.  <p> but that doesn't help.  He considers it but refuses it;
refuses it <i>against his expressed better judgement</i>, indeed. This
is a tragedy and the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is written in the stars.
While we are about it, the Maitre d' clearly knows what is going to
happen, since he swiftly takes cover and makes himself scarce.<p>
We should not be surprised by Python writing a Tragedy.  Python is
very interested in <i>media</i>, in <i>formats:</i> Game shows, chat shows, news items . . . <p>

<p> The fact
that he destroyed by an <i>explosion</i> is down to Python being a
surrealist operation.  (Is there a connection here with Bunbury, whom
Lady Bracknell thinks is destroyed by an explosion? (``Exploded! Was
he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?'') Are there other
surrealist tragedies?  <p> Colleagues on whom i have tried out this
analysis sometimes say that it isn't a tragedy beco's there is no
moral dimension to it.  I'm not sure that that's entirely true;
presumably it depends to a certain extent on whether or not Creosote
has free will.  Perhaps he has no free will, since his only function
is to be a personification of gluttony, but that sort of question is a
problem in all tragedies anyway. If my colleagues are correct you
could think of <i>Creosote</i> as a kind of independence-proof that
Tragedy is not a moral concept.  <hr> While we are on the subject of
tragedy, Fawlty Towers is of course a tragedy not a comedy. (Which is why it is so painful to watch). But that's
for another time.  <hr>
