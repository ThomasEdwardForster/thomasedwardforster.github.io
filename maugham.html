   ``At the hospital.  Two men were great friends; they lunched together,
    worked together and played together: they were inseparable.  One of 
    them went home for a few days, and in his absence the other got
    blood-poisoning at a <i>post-mortem</i> and forty-eight hours later died.
    The first came back: he'd made an appointment to meet his friend in
    the P.M. room; when he went in he found him lying on the slab naked
    and dead.<p>

   ``It gave me quite a turn'' he said when he told me.''

From Somerset Maugham's commonplace book, dated 1893.  Maugham was at one
point a medical student.  This presumably comes from that period.  
(Philosophy students will recognise a connection with <A HREF=http://www.ditext.com/gettier/gettier.html>
the famous 
article of Edmund. L. Gettier III.</A>)
