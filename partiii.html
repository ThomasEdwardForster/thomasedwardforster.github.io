Gerald Sacks on Mathematical Logic:
<p>
  ``Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. The subject of
mathematical logic splits fourfold into: recursive
functions, the heart of the subject; proof theory,
which includes the best theorem in the subject; sets
and classes, <i> whose romantic appeal far outweigh their
mathematical substance</i>; and model theory, whose value
is its applicability to, and roots in, algebra.''

If you are interested in pursuing set theory at all then you may well
be curious about the foundational role of set theory and wonder where
the axioms came from and what they are supposed to do.  <A
HREF="cam_only/axiomsofsettheory.pdf"> An Introduction to the Axioms
of Set Theory </A> (which is the current draught of a short book I am
writing for CUP) just might be part of what you are looking for.



<hr> <p> 

You might be interested in writing the essay on  <A HREF = "partiiiessay1.pdf"> Set Theory Without the Axiom of Foundation </A> or perhaps the essay on <A HREF = "partiiiessay2.pdf"> Better Quasi-orders </A>.

 This year (2006/7) the course is entitled `Logic and Set Theory'. The
appropriate extract from the Part III handbook is  <A HREF =
"partiiiheader2007.pdf"> here </A>.

 The prerequisites for this are all provided in the Part II ``Logic,
and Set theory'' course - which I used to lecture and
which is, by a happy coincidence, covered in my book
 <A HREF = "baby.html"> Logic, Induction and Sets </A>.  Professor Johnstone's book
"Notes on set theory" is good too.  Raymond Liu has kindly allowed me to post here his 
<A HREF = "cam_only/liuSTLnotes.pdf"> notes of Professor Hyland's Part II Set Theory 
and Logic lectures </A>.  It is Professor Hyland who is currently 
lecturing this course.


<p> 


The notes for my lectures come in two main files.  The bulk of it -
everything except BQO theory and the theory of computable functions -
is <A HREF= "cam_only/partiii2004.pdf"> here </A>.  These have been
weeded of not only the messages to myself, and false starts etc etc
but even the assorted fun things that aren't examinable but which it
breaks my heart to leave out.  The sacrifices one makes...  <p> The <A
HREF ="cam_only/BQObok.pdf"> notes on BQO theory </A> have not been as
thoroughly weeded.   <p> I
shall also cover some of the Theory of Computable functions but I have
no plans to put here any materials relevant to it. This is adequately
covered in <i>Logic, Induction and Sets</i> and <i>Notes on Set
Theory</i>.  I can't think of anything I can usefully add to chapter 6
of Logic, Induction and Sets. <p> 


Here is the pdf file of the <A HREF ="cam_only/extractedmodel.pdf">  independence of the axiom of extensionality  </A> .

 <p> I found <A HREF
="http://ellemose.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/lamreduce"> this </A> rather
nice lambda-calculus reduction workbench.  I hope you will find it
fun.
 <p> 

The choice-free version of the Erd\"os-Rado theorem is not in the
notes as I'm writing it up for publication, and 
<A HREF ="cam_only/erdosrado.pdf"> here </A> is the version I have sent off to
the JSL.

 <p> 

 <A HREF ="cam_only/fundamentalsequence.pdf"> Here  </A> are my notes for the CS minicourse on Countable ordinals.  I will undoubtedly lecture at least <i>some</i> of this stuff.   

<p>

I will probably not get round to lecturing in detail the logical roots
of Ramsey's theorem.  Even if I do, punters will probably appreciate
having it set out in idiot-proof form. This link: 
<A HREF="cam_only/ramsey.pdf"> A commentary on Ramsey's original paper </A> is to my
notes-for-myself on those roots.  (I am the idiot in question, and
these notes are messages to myself designed to supply what is needed for
refreshing my memory every time i forget it).

<p>
This year for the first time i intend to cover the theorem of Frayne, Morel and Scott that elementarily equivalent structures have isomorphic ultralimits. <A HREF="cam_only/frayne.pdf"> Here  </A> is the handout.

<p> 
I hope Timothy Chow won't mind me putting in this link to his notes of
<A HREF ="http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/mathstuff/forcingdum">forcing for beginners....</A>


(If this link doesn't work for you, edit the window to remove the reference to dpmms. Not sure why my server puts that in ....)
<p> 

Wilfried Buchholz has allowed me to use his <i>very</i> cute proof of the
multiset ordering theorem.  <A HREF ="cam_only/buch.ps"> Read it and improve your soul. </A>


The proof that Rieger-Bernays permutation models preserve stratified 
formulae is in, for example my  <A HREF =
"churchlatest.ps"> Church festschrift paper </A>.  The proof that they
preserve the axiom of replacement i am leaving as an exercise.

<p><A HREF ="cam_only/HSnonce.ps"> Here </A> is an explanation of why the sets hereditarily of finite support form a model of ZF (minus foundation and choice)
 <p>

Here are notes by an anonymous hand of Woodin's lectures on Large cardinals 
and determinacy. <A HREF ="cam_only/woodinLargeCardsDetcypart1.pdf"> Part 1 </A>, 
<A HREF ="cam_only/woodinLargeCardsDetcypart2.pdf"> Part 2 </A> ,
<A HREF ="cam_only/woodinLargeCardsDetcypart3.pdf"> Part 3 </A> ,
<A HREF ="cam_only/woodinLargeCardsDetcypart4.pdf"> Part 4 </A>  and 
<A HREF ="cam_only/woodinLargeCardsDetcypart5.pdf"> Part 5 </A> .<br>
I would very much like to lecture this, co's it is <i>very</i> cute, but 
i doubt i shall get round to it.



</p>
I also include here assorted miscellaneous teaching materials that punters might find helpful, but which are not directly alluded to...

<p> 
For the moment there appears to be only one item not directly connected with this year's Part III course:
<p> 
<A HREF ="henkin.ps"> My commentary on Henkin's papers on omega-incompleteness </A>
