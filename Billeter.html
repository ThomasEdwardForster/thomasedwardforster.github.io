</h2> <p>My maternal grandfather seems to have been (I met him only
once, when i was less than 2) an entirely admirable and lovable
man. (It's from him that i get my music genes [i still have much of
his piano music, a volume of Beethoven Piano sonatas etc ect] and my
bald X-chromosome) And a resolute feminist (in striking contrast to my
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Llewelyn_Bulkeley_Williams"><i>paternal</i> 
grandfather </A> who was a prominent and vociferous
anti-suffragist). Language buffs reading this page may know that, in
French, one uses the feminine third person plural form `<i>elles</i>'
only when <i>every single one</i> of the humans being denoted is
female.  My grandfather took the view that the rule should be that one
would use the <i>elles</i> form as long as <i>a simple majority</i> of
the humans being denoted consisted of females.<p> But never mind that!
My mother married my father (he wasn't my father when she married him
but etc etc) who was &mdash; if not then, but later &mdash; an anglican.  No
recorded reaction from my Grandfather, who was (i think) a
``Feuerbachian'' atheist (my mother's expression) like <A HREF
="billeter.html"> his father</A>. So far so good. However, my mother's
younger sister Suzanne then married a <i>French Catholic</i> and my
grandfather went through the roof.  My mother remonstrated with him &mdash;
for once in her life, reasonably &mdash; on the grounds that <i>she</i> had
married a believer and the sky had not fallen in, and besides: ``<i>Tu
es libre-penseur</i>'' [in the suisse-romande one <i>tutoye</i>
everyone to whom one acknowledges a blood relationship] so what should
it matter what flavour of believer she married?  My grandfather's
reply has passed into legend<p> ``Bien entendu je suis libre-penseur, mais je
suis libre-penseur <b>protestant!!''</b><p>
