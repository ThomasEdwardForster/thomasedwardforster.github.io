Rhetorical Manoeuvres, Sophistry and Pragmatism
A traditional pastime of philosophers is analysing sophistry. Some rhetorical manoeuvres  border on subtle rejections of the normative status philosophers have traditionally accorded logical principles of reasoning. This paper considers whether some such manoeuvres amount to or can be grounded in a pragmatist challenge to certain conceptions of rationality, or whether they can be dismissed as sophistical.
