Almighty and most merciful Father,<br>
we have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep.<br>
We have followed too much the devices and desires<br>
of our own hearts.  We have offended against thy holy laws.<br>
We have left undone those things which we ought to have done;<br>
and we have done those things which we ought not to have done;<br>
and there is no health in us.

My love of this text stems from my Anglican upbringing. I never
believed a word of it &mdash;  <i>ever</i> &mdash; but i loved the music and i loved
the language then as i still love it now.  <A HREF="abram.html">Wilfrid
Owen </A> obviously loved it too.  Lines 5 and 6 in particular must
have impressed themselves on Eliot, but that point has presumably been
well made before.  Perhaps one reason why i like The Waste Land is
that the language sometimes reminds me of the Book of Common Prayer. I
once set <A HREF="The_Song_of_the_Third_Thames_Maiden"> The Song Of The Third Thames Maiden</A> to
music&mdash;it's a study in octatonic harmony and the mp3 file is <A HREF="The_Song_of_the_Third_Thames_Maiden.mp3">here</A>  <p> And there is no
health in us.  ``We are, of course&mdash;all of us&mdash;worms''
Churchill is supposed to have said ``but I like to think that I might
be a glow-worm''.  <p> I think I'd settle for being a glow-worm.
