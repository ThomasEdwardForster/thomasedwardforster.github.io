	          <FONT SIZE="+1"> </h2> <p> ``The problem with this
stuff is not that it's bad <i>Philosophy</i>*; the problem is that it
is bad <i>Poetry</i>.''  <hr> *tho' it is that too.  <p> Jules Bean
was a Trinity Mathmo whom i supervised for Third Year Logic.  <hr> I
think Jules has put his finger on something.  FLT (and that's
<i>French Literary Theory</i> not <i>Fermat's Last Theorem</i> by the
way) does spend a lot of time speaking in riddles. This annoys me
greatly &mdash; perhaps more than it should. For my part <i>I</i> don't
write in riddles &mdash; the stuff i try to do is quite difficult enuff as
it is without my taking steps to step to make the readers' experience
any worse.  Speaking in riddles seems to me to be self-indulgent, to be <i>irresponsible
. . . . unprofessional</i>.  It makes it very difficult for me to
regard these people as colleagues.  And that's even before you start
worrying about the content.  (content..?)
