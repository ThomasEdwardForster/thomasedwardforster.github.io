Anon.  (Oral tradition)

That version was told me by my big sister.  The Russian version below was taught me by my superstar Russian teacher at M********gh,  Richard Pollock, who was poached by the University of Salford to run their Modern Languages department.
Apparently it's a standard Russian trope. (It says ``I know nothing'' (x 4); ``Good'' (x 2).)  Pollock went on to be the interpreter who mediated between Mrs Thatcher and Gorbachoff.  He was a hero. Totally amazing.
