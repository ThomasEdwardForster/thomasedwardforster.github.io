<A HREF ="logicforlinguists.pdf">Here</A> are the notes from which I
will be lecturing this course.  Readers should
bear in mind that they are <i>lecture notes</i> and are not proper
tested-on-animals <i>course materials</i>.  I do not recommend that you download them, since they are work-in-progress and they will constantly change.  <br>

I have written out those things that I fear I might omit in the hurry
of a live performance; I have written out also - in some cases in
considerable detail - those things that I suspect I might get wrong;
there is some material that i haven't got time to cover in the detail
I would like, but that is covered adequately (I hope!) in the notes;
material that I know I can do standing on my head is reduced to mere
bullet points. What with one thing and another you can see that access
to this file is not an entirely adequate substitute for taking your
own notes: indeed i shall be offering a small prize for the best set
of notes taken!

<hr>
If your college is willing to pay for supervisions I will be happy to offer them.

I supply links to two files which overlap these notes.<hr>

<A HREF ="chchlectures.pdf">Lecture Notes on Logic for Philosophy Students</A>.

Much of the importance of Logic for Philosophy comes from the lessons
it has to teach us about <i>reasoning</i>; we, for our part, are
interested in it for what it has to tell us about <i>language</i>.  So
the material therein concerning rules of inference, validity
<i>etc.</i> are going to be of limited interest.  However, the
semantics is important, and logicians, like linguists, are very
interested in <i>translation</i>.
