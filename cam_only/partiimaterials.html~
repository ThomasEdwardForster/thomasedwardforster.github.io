I include here a shameless plug for <A HREF =
"baby.html"> Logic Induction and Sets </A>, the most wonderful
introduction to&mdash;well&mdash;<i>Logic, Induction and Sets </i> that
the world has ever seen.  I'm not suggesting for even one moment that
you should <i> read </i> it: just <i> buy </i> it!  However, if you
really <i>do</i> want to actually read it you will need to refer to
the <A HREF = "http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/typoslis.html"> page of
typos</A>.  It was written to the same syllabus for the old Part II
logic course of <i>circa</i> 2000 that also gave rise to Professor
Johnstone's <i> Notes on Logic and Set Theory </i>. That course has
now bifurcated into the two courses to which this page is devoted: the
languages-and-automata material from that old course has been hived
off into Dr Chiodo's (now Dr Button's) course where it is joined by
some material on
PDAs and context-free grammars that was not in the old course (see
below); the bulk of the material has gone into <i>ST&L</i>.  Old Exam
questions going back to the 1990s will still be relevant to people
pursuing <b>both</b> courses; such people will benefit from reading
either Prof Johnstone's book or mine.<hr> <hr>

I am guilty of two pdfs which contain most (if not all) the basic
logic and discrete maths that in my not-so-humble opinion should be in
the backpack of every young mathematician about town.  One on <A
HREF="countability.pdf"> Countability</A> and another on <A
HREF="CUPdiscretelectures.pdf"> Discrete Mathematics</A>.  Read through
them quickly, it won't take long.

 Professor Leader's lecture notes for this course are available from
<A HREF="http://tartarus.org/gareth/maths/notes/"> Gareth Taylor </A>
(may he live for ever) and students will find them very helpful.  My
lecture notes from 2016/7 are <A HREF = "partiilectures2016.pdf"> here
</A>. 

<hr> When lecturing this course in 2016/7 i started by talking about
ordinals, so I made available a cleaned up version of my <A HREF =
"TMStalk2012.pdf"> talk on ordinals</A> to the Trinity Mathematical
Society from 2012.  There is also <A HREF ="fundamentalsequence.pdf">
notes on countable ordinals </A> which might be useful, but they
should be read (if at all!) only <i> after</i> the TMS notes.  Actually there is <A HREF="ordinalsforwelly.pdf"> slightly later series of notes </A> that you might like to at least start on.

In previous years i made my supervision-notes-and-discussions-of-old-examples-sheets-and-tripos-questions available to all
Cambridge students but i have reluctantly concluded that the easy
availability of these materials (i have been struck by the number of
students consulting them who are supervised by people other than me)
makes it easier for the faculty to not support logic properly, so i
have taken them down.  If your supervisor is not able to supply these resources then take it up with your Director of Studies.  That is the only way things will change.  If you really want to see these materials then ask me, and
have a good story handy &mdash; like: you're a Queens person, or the
offspring of an old girlfriend, or anything else that might tug on my
heartstrings.

I suspect that the students attending this course make a bimodal distribution.
You may be someone who needs a lo-stress C course to keep your life under
control, or you may be an enthusiast who really <i>really</i> wants to know
about computability.  If you are of the second inclination you might like
to keep an eye on the Part III reading course in <i>Computability and Logic</i>
for which i have some sort of responsibility; look at
<A HREF="partiiimaterials.html"> my Part III page </A>. <p>
Either way you might like to cast an eye over <A HREF="blog.pdf"> my
supervision notes for this course </A>(I have been supervising it since
its inception and i have accumulated 50-odd pages of observations.)  Read
at you own risk.

You will find very useful Prof Pitts' materials on <A HREF=
"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1213/RLFA/materials.html"> Languages
and Automata </A> on the computer laboratory's course pages; ditto his
<A HREF="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1819/CompTheory/"> CS 1B materials </A>. <br>
You may find <A HREF="x10nonce.pdf">my discussion of the last part of Q10 on his sheet</A> useful: it concerns the question of why the Ackermann function is not primitive recursive even tho' its slices are.<br>

There is a slight mismatch between his materials and Dr Button's in
that our course covers push-down automata and context-free languages
(which CS doesn't&mdash;(I think!) and we do not cover lambda calculus
whereas they do.  Nevertheless, Prof Pitts' materials come with the
highest possible recommendation.  He is sensationally organised and
the materials are beautifully set out.

Here are my <A HREF ="languages-and-automata.pdf">Regular Languages
and Finite Automata </A> materials (originally written for Queen Mary)
in pdf format.  I am greatly endebted to Chlo&euml; Brown for creating
a <A HREF ="langs-and-automata/main.html"> version in html </A>.  This
version is preferable in various ways to the pdf version, since the
answers to the exercises are not immediately visible in the way they
are in the .pdf version, but can be seen only when you click on the
link.  Thank you, Chlo&euml; Brown!! Here <A HREF ="112coursework2answers.pdf">
is a file of answers to the coursework questions at the end </A>.

Some of you have asked me whether Regular languages are good for
anything.  These <A HREF ="arthur-norman.pdf"> notes of Arthur
Norman's </A> on the hardness of the equality problem for regular
languages may be of interest to strong students.  <hr> 

This <A HREF ="chiodosheetIVq4i.pdf"> discussion answer to Sheet 4
Question 4 Part (i)  </A> of Dr Chiodo's 2017 materials might be useful.
 <hr>
Here is <A HREF ="2017p4q4H.pdf">a discussion of 2017 paper 4 question 4H</A>.
 <hr>
Here is <A HREF ="2017p3q11H.pdf">a discussion of 2017 paper 3 question 11H</A>.

 <hr>
This <A HREF ="mauricenonce.pdf"> discussion answer to Sheet 2 Question 1 Part (d)  </A> of Dr Chiodo's 2016 materials might be useful.<br>
Here is a discussion of  the last part of <A HREF ="2009p6q3.pdf"> 2009 paper 6 question 3 </A> of the CS Tripos.<hr>
Here is the pdf file of the notes of Richard Crouch's second-year course at 
the University of Nottingham on <A HREF ="crouchnotes.pdf"> Languages, Computation and Automata</A>. They do not correspond exactly to any course here, but students might find them useful: they are <i> very</i> meaty.
<hr> I found this rather nice <A HREF
="http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/lamreduce/"> lambda-calculus reduction workbench</A>.  I hope you will find it fun.
