When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand
to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished
at how much the old man had learned in seven years.

Mark Twain
<p> <hr>

At the time of Franklin, and &mdash; later &mdash; Mark Twain, there is no doubt
the Americans had a sense of irony.  People as late as Thurber had it
too.  When someone told him the women in his drawings had no sex
appeal (a very 1950's expression) he replied ``They have for my men''.
<p> I have heard the theory that their lack of irony is because WASP
America has -&mdash;thanks to the damned Puritans &mdash; no indigeneous
theatre. In particular they do not have Pantomime. Theatre arrived
later, with Jews and other Europeans but by then the damage was done.
Thurber I think had German antecedents. (He had a brother called
Hermann, and there are bits of German text that appear in his writing
without comment or glossing.)  His retort certainly reveals an
instinctive understanding of theatre, and of the dignities and rights
of fictional creatures, without which theatre is impossible.  <p> Somehow all this has got lost in modern
America.  (And don't tell me about Randy Newman: he is a miraculous
freak)
