``Unless you are very unlucky'' said <A HREF = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_William_K%C3%B6rner">

Tom K&ouml;rner </A>to a group of
trainee supervisors years ago ``You will one day have a student who is cleverer
than you are.  That is not a problem; it is a treat''.

<p>
<hr>

The cleverer you are the more you enjoy it, but the less likely it is
to happen.  If you are a bit dim then it happens all the time but is no
fun.  You have to multiply the probability of having such a student by
the amount of enjoyment you derive.  That way you can predict how much fun you can expect.<br> I think i am in the fortunate position
where my enjoyment is maximised.
