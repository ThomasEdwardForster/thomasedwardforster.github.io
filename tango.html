It's not a tango; more a reminiscence of one.

I think he's right.  One can't really imagine anyone dancing to this piece, but <i>ruminating</i>, yes.<br>
Actually Albeniz wrote more than one tango.  There is another one called <i>Bajo La Palmera</i> which is very

The trouble is, far too many people know Albeniz' music only through guitar transcriptions. Same goes for Granados.
Neither of these two gentlemen ever wrote a <i>note</i> for the guitar (even for John Williams) but they did write
some wonderful piano music....<i>Lots,</i> actually....
