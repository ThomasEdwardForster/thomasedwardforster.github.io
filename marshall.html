<i>A man's reach should exceed his grasp, else what's a metaphor?</i>
<p>
Marshall McLuhan
<hr>
I never met Marshall McLuhan, tho' I met people who did, chiefly <A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barker_Fairley"> Barker Fairley</A> (who once painted my portrait, which i still have).  One of them (can't remember which) said
<p>
``<i>Marshall is a prophet; by that I don't mean that what he says comes to pass, I mean that something speaks out of him and he doesn't know what it is.''</i>

<p>

Well ... perhaps there's something in that .... Now that we have been pitchforked into the internet age it might just be worth looking at what McLuhan had to say&mdash;well, <i>prophesy</i>&mdash;about it.
