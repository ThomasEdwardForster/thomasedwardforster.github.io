(Mr. Eliot's Sunday Evening Postscript)
<br><p>

As we get older we do not get any younger.
<br> Seasons return, and to-day I am fifty-five,
<br>And this time last year I was fifty-four
<br>And this time next year I shall be sixty-two.
<br>And I cannot say I should like (to speak for myself)
<br>To see my time over again - if you can call it time:
<br>Fidgeting uneasily under a draughty stair,
<br>Or counting sleepless nights in the crowded tube.
<p>
<br>There are certain precautions - though none of them very reliable -
<br>Against the blast from bombs and the flying splinter,
<br>But not against the blast from heaven, vento dei venti,
<br>The wind within a wind unable to speak for wind;
<br>And the frigid burnings of purgatory will not be touched
<br>By any emollient.
<br>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		I think you will find this put,
<br>Better than I could ever hope to express it,
<br>In the words of Kharma: 'It is, we believe,
<br>Idle to hope that the simple stirrup-pump
<br>Will extinguish hell.'
<br>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Oh, listeners,
<br>And you especially who have turned off the wireless,
<br>And sit in Stoke or Basingstoke listening appreciatively to
<br>	the silence,
<br>(Which is also the silence of hell) pray, not for your skins,
<br>	but for your souls.
<p>

<br>And pray for me also under the draughty stair.
<br>As we get older we do not get any younger.
<br>And pray for Kharma under the holy mountain.

I learnt a new word the other day, from a copy (which i found in an op
shop in Gisborne) of <i>Mauve Gloves and Madmen, Clutter and Vine</i>
by that startlingly obnoxious Tom Wolfe.  I mean the man is a total
arsehole, for heavan's sake. The word is <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antanaclasis"><i>antanaclasis</i></A>
of which this poem serves us two examples: `Stoke or Basingstoke', and
`...wind within a wind, unable to speak for wind'.  That second
example is really rather good, beco's the original that it parodies
(`word within a word, unable to speak a word') is <i>not</i> an
antanaclasis.  Eliot uses quite a lot of antanaclasis, so this is
actually quite a clever piece of parody, in that it is a parody not of
the <i>text</i> but of the <i>techniques used in the text</i> more
generally.  <p> It's often been said that a good parody must first of
all be a good poem. ``Idle to hope that the simple stirrup pump will
extinguish hell".  A lovely line, that.  So Eliot: sounds marvellous
and profound but what does it actually mean?  Indeed Eliot apparently
liked this poem. "Most parodies of one's own work strike one as very
poor. In fact, one is apt to think one could parody oneself much
better. (As a matter of fact, some critics have said that I have done
so.) But there is one which deserves the success it has had, Henry
Reed's <i>Chard Whitlow</i>''



<p> `Chard Whitlow' is clearly a reference to the village names in the
titles of the poems Eliot was writing at that time.  The title is
actually the weakest part of this little gem, for English village
names are fatally easy to parody; Private Eye have been doing it for
years.  Sir Herbert Gussett writes from <i>Loose Chippings</i> and
from <i>Milton Friedman.</i> I've been guilty of a few myself:
<i>Gunghoe</i> is obviously somewhere in the Chilterns, <i>Flimsea</i>
and <i>Outreach</i> are of course in the Fens, <i>Frisby</i> is a pit
village in the East Midlands (now sadly down on its luck);
<i>Duffcar</i> is up-country from Newcastle, and <i>Pol Pot</i> must
be a Cornish fishing village [or perhaps the site of an abandoned tin
mine?]....but where is <i>Long Natter</i>?  One day I am going to
write a prolix Trollopean novel set in the Cathedral city of
<i>Heominster</i>. (Yes, it <i> does</i> rhyme with `Leominster', <i>
of course</i>). In this connection the New Zealanders among us should
also remember the small North Island lakeside town of
<i>Waiwhakakiwi</i>.  I have friends who estivate on the Greek island
of <i>Seroxat</i>. I have a hot date (keep fingers crossed for me) with a crazy American woman at the resort on the micronesian island of <i>Nambi Pambi</i>.  I am not alone in having a weakness for made-up
names.  Stephen Leacock gave us <i>Lake Owatawetness</i> and Bill
Bryson the New England settlement of <i> Squashaninsect</i>.  Nor
should we forget that only the other day Radio 4 revealed to an
astonished world the goings-on in the little English village of
<i>Bickering</i>.  Thank God there are still people around who care about
language.  <hr>
