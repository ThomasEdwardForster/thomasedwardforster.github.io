<br>
I saw a jolly hunter
<br>
with a jolly gun
<br>
Walking in the country
<br>
In the jolly sun
<br>

<p>


In the jolly meadow
<br>
sat a jolly hare
<br>
saw the jolly hunter
<br>
took jolly care
<br>
<p>

Hunter jolly eager
<br>
sight of jolly prey
<br>
forgot gun pointing
<br>
wrong jolly way(!)
<br>

<p>


Jolly hunter jolly head
<br>
over heels gone
<br>
jolly old safety catch
<br>
not jolly on!
<br>

<p>


Bang! went the jolly gun
<br>
Hunter jolly dead
<br>
Jolly prey* got clean away
<br>
Jolly good I said

*The original has `hare' here, but I prefer `prey' with the internal
rhyme.  Sod the poet. Well, perhaps not sod the poet after all,
as i'm almost certainly in breach of copyright posting this here. It's
from a volume of poems he wrote for children, and one of my
stepdaughters showed it me.  <hr> If you buy the book he might forgive
me.
