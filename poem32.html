<br>When awful darkness and silence reign
<br>Over the great Gromboolian plain,
<br>Through the long, long wintry nights;-
<br>When the angry breakers roar
<br>As they beat on the rocky shore;-
<br>When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights
<br>Of the hills of the Chankly Bore:-
<br>
<br>Then, through the vast and gloomy dark,
<br>There moves what seems a fiery spark,
<br>A lonely spark with silvery rays
<br>Piercing the coal-black night,-
<br>Hither and thither the vision strays,
<br>A single lurid light.
<br>
<br>Slowly it wanders, pauses, creeps, 
<br>Anon it sparkles, flashes and leaps;
<br>And ever as onward it gleaming goes
<br>A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.
<br>And those who watch at that midnight hour
<br>From Hall or Terrace, or lofty Tower,
<br>Cry, as the wild light passes along, 
<br>    "The Dong!&mdash;the Dong!
<br>    "The wandering Dong through the forest goes!
<br>    "The Dong! the Dong!
<br>    "The Dong with a luminous Nose!"
<br>
<br>Long years ago
<br>The Dong was happy and gay,
<br>Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl
<br>Who came to those shores one day.
<br>For the Jumblies came in a Sieve, they did, 
<br>Landing at Eve near the Zemmery Fidd
<br>Where the Oblong Oysters grow,
<br>And the rocks are smooth and gray.
<br>And all the woods and the valleys rang
<br>With the chorus they daily and nightly sang, 
<br>    "Far and few, far and few,
<br>    Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
<br>    Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
<br>    And they went to sea in a sieve."
<br>
<br>Happily, happily passed those days!
<br>While the cheerful Jumblies staid;
<br>They danced in circlets all night long,
<br>To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,
<br>In moonlight, shine or shade.
<br>For day and night he was always there
<br>By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,
<br>With her sky-blue hands, and her sea-green hair.
<br>Till the morning came of that hateful day
<br>When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,
<br>And the Dong was left on the cruel shore
<br>Gazing&mdash;gazing for evermore,
<br>Ever keeping his weary eyes on
<br>That pea-green sail on the far horizon,
<br>Singing the Jumbly Chorus still
<br>As he sate all day on the grassy hill, 
<br>    "Far and few, far and few,
<br>    Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
<br>    Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
<br>    And they went to sea in a sieve."
<br>
<br>But when the sun was low in the West,
<br>The Dong arose and said, 
<br>"What little sense I once possessed
<br>Has quite gone out of my head!"
<br>And since that day he wanders still
<br>By lake and forest, marsh and hill,
<br>Singing&mdash;"O somewhere, in valley or plain
<br>"Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!
<br>"For ever I'll seek by lake and shore
<br>"Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!"
<br>
<br>Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,
<br>Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks,
<br>And because by night he could not see,
<br>He gathered the bark of Twangum Tree
<br>On the flowery plain that grows.
<br>And he wove him a wondrous Nose,
<br>A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!
<br>Of vast proportions and painted red,
<br>And tied with cords to the back of his head.
<br>- In a hollow rounded space it ended
<br>With a luminous lamp within suspended,
<br>All fenced about
<br>With a bandage stout
<br>To prevent the wind from blowing it out;
<br>And with holes all round to send the light,
<br>In gleaming rays on the dismal night.
<br>
<br>And now each night, and all night long,
<br>Over those plains still roams the Dong;
<br>And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe
<br>You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe
<br>While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain
<br>To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;
<br>Lonely and wild - all night he goes,
<br>The Dong with a luminous Nose!
<br>And all who watch at the midnight hour,
<br>From Hall or Terrace, or lofty Tower,
<br>Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,
<br>Moving along through the dreary night,
<br>    "This is the hour when forth he goes,
<br>    "The Dong with a luminous Nose!
<br>    "Yonder - over the plain he goes;
<br>               "He goes!
<br>              "He goes;
<br>    "The Dong with a luminous Nose!" 


<hr> Edward Lear <hr> I encountered Lear when I was a small child and
I cannot remember a time when I didn't love him.  (One of my sisters 
gave me a copy of <i> The Owl and the Pussycat</i> when i was packed 
off to boarding school but i knew him before that.) How can you not 
love Lear? Any more than you can not love Blake... He speaks to us of 
loss and sorrow, of desolation; these are of course universal facts 
about the human condition, but the way in which he wraps them up for 
us is all his own.  One is disarmed by the nonsense&mdash;and Lear seems 
to be the first ``artist'' who uses nonsense in this way&mdash;and 
slightly disconcerted by the mismatch between the reality of the pain 
he describes and the absurd context in which it is placed.  But it is 
precisely that mismatch that enables the message to be more abstract&mdash;and therefore more universal:

<p><i>For day and night he was always there <br>By the side of the
Jumbly Girl so fair, <br>With her sky-blue hands, and her sea-green
hair.  <br>Till the morning came of that hateful day <br>When the
Jumblies sailed in their sieve away.....</i> <p> Observe the very
formal and stylised nature of this description: blue is <i>of
course</i> sky-blue: green is <i>of course</i> sea-green.  She is
being apostrophised in entirely <i>conventional</i> terms.  The
clich&eacute;s are there to prevent us being distracted by specifics:
a less hackneyed and more vivid simile would have been less effective&mdash;beco's less abstract, as i say. And note, too, that that line is the 
only instance in the poem where there are three consecutive lines with 
the one rhyme.  That device spins out and prolongs the idyllic mood 
that....he is just about to explode with the cruel line that follows.
