When Tom and Elizabeth took the farm
<br>The bracken made their bed
<br>and Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle<br>
The magpies said
<p>
Tom's hand was strong to the plough<br>
and Elizabeth's lips were red<br>
and Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle
<br>The magpies said
<p>
Year in year out they worked<br>
while the pines grew overhead
<br>and Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle<br>
The magpies said
<p>
But all the beautiful crops soon went
<br>to the mortgage man instead
<br>and Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle
<br>The magpies said
<p>
Elizabeth is dead now (it's long ago)
<br>Old Tom's gone light in the head
<br>and Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle<br>
The magpies said
<p>
The farm's still there. Mortgage corporations 
<br>couldn't give it away
<br>and Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle<br>
The magpies say.

Artists are people who make us see the world differently.  Altho' Glover may
not have been the greatest poet of all time he was an entirely real one, but
he has always been easy to underestimate because his versification is so
domestic and so easy on the ear that one doesn't notice how skilful it is.
<i>Ars celare artem</i>. Once you know this poem, whenever you hear a New Zealand
(well, Australian) magpie call, you will hear it as Glover tells us to hear it:
magpies say ``Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle''- they really do . . . . or at
least they do now! Ask any New Zealander.  (The sound made by the same bird in
Australia was described by <A HREF = "http://petercareybooks.com/"> Peter Carey
</A> as ``an angel gargling'').
<p>
The fact that this is actually quite a good wee poem about what the Great
Depression did to farming is a pleasant bonus that is in danger of being
overlooked.


<p> Janet Paul once told me that I was better company than Glover
because he was drunk all the time.  I treasure this compliment: to
judge by the poetry he wrote Glover must have been very good company
indeed. (<i>memo to self: stay off bottle!</i>)
