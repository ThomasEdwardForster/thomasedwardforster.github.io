Kleene has this theorem that says that if ${\cal K}$ is a first-order axiomatisable class of ${\cal L}$-structures with an (infinite) semidecidable set of axioms then there is an expansion blah

Examples: bipartite graphs.  Also the puzzle about tiling the chessboard with domino pieces leaving diagonally opposite points of blah.   Is there a theorem in finite model theory corresponding to this result of Kleene's?

Lots of examples of thngs that have infinite axiomatisations that clearly cannot be finitised in the same language  fields of characteristic zero, algebraically closed fields...
