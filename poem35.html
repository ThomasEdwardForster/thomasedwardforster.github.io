<br>

If you can keep your head when all about you
<br>
are losing theirs and blaming it on you
<br>
If you can keep your faith when all men doubt you
<br>
but make allowance for their doubting too
<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting
<br> 
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies.
<br>
Or being hated, don't give way to hating
<br>
and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.
<p>
<br>
If you can dream and not make dreams your master

<br>

If you can make a heap of all your winnings and
<br>
bet them on one turn of pitch and toss
<br>
and lose, and start again on your beginnings
<br>
and never breathe a word about your loss
<br>
<br>

<br>

<p>


If you can walk with crowds and keep your virtue
<br>
and walk with Kings nor lose the common touch
<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you
<br>
If all men count with you but none too much
<br>

<br>



If you can fill the unforgiving minute
<br>
with 60" worth of distance run
<br>
Yours is the world and everything that's in it
<br>
and---what is more---you'll be a man my son.

<br>

I am that which began
<br>
Out of me the years roll
<br>
Out of me God and Man
<br>
I am equal and whole
<br>
God changes and Man, and the form of them bodily---I am the soul


<br>

<br>


Before ever land was
<br>
Before ever the sea
<br>
Or soft hair of the grass
<br>
or fair limbs of the tree
<br>
Or the flesh-coloured fruit of my branches I was---and thy soul was in me


<br>

<br>


First life on my sources
<br>
First drifted and swam
<br>
Out of me are the forces
<br>
That save it or damn
<br>
Out of me man and woman and wild-beast and bird---before God was, I am

<br>
They told me, Heraclitus, they told me you were dead
<br>
They brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to shed
<br>
I wept when i remembered how often you and I 

had tired the sun with talking and sent him down the sky.
<br>
<br>

And now that thou art lying, my dear old carian guest
<br>
a handful of grey ashes, long, long ago at rest
<br>
Still are thy angel voices, thy nightingales, awake
<br>
For death he taketh all awa---but these he cannot take
<br>


Her mother's so hail-fellow-well-met
<br>
Her handshake is pure Black and Decker
<br>
She wears khaki shorts and pith helmet
<br>
and tells you to keep up your pecker.
<br>



If i could tell you i would let you know


Full lasting is the song tho' he
<br>
the singer, passes.  Lasting,  too
<br>
---for those not lent in usury---
<br>
the rapture of the forward view


What are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?

The barbarians are due here today

Why isn't anything going on in the senat?
Why are the senators sitting there without legislating?

Because the Barbarians are coming today 
What's the point of senators making laws now?
Once the barbarians are here, they'll do the legislating

Why did our emperor get up so early
and why is he sitting enthroned at the city's main gate
in state, wearing the crown?

Because the barbarians are coming today 
and the emperor's waiting to receive their leader
He's even got a scroll to give him
loaded with titles, with imposing names.




Why have our two consuls and praetors come out today
wearing their embroidered, their scarlet togas?
Why have they put on bracelets with so many amethysts
rings sparkling with magnificent emeralds?
Why are they carrying elegant canes,
beautifully worked in silver and gold?

Because the barbarians are coming today,            
and things like that dazzle the barbarians

Why don't our distinguished orators turn up as usual
to make their speeches, say what they have to say?

Because the barbarians are coming today 
and they're bored by rhetoric and public speaking


Why this sudden bewilderment, this confusion?
(How serious people's faces have become)
Why are the streets and squares emptying so rapidly,
everyone going home lost in thought?

Because night has fallen and the barbarians haven't come
and some of our men just in from the border say
that there are no barbarians any longer


Now what's going to happen to us without barbarians?
These people were a kind of solution
