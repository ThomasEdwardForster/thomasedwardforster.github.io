<h1>Operations on machines and languages</h1>
<p>Languages are sets, and there are operations one can perform on them simply in
virtue of their being sets. If <i>K</i> and <i>L</i> are languages, so obviously are <i>K</i>&#8746;<i>L</i>, <i>K</i>&#8745;<i>L</i>
and <i>K</i> \ <i>L</i>. There is one further operation that we need which is defined only
because languages are sets of strings and there are operations we can perform
on strings, specifically concatenation. This concatenation of strings gives us a
notion of concatenation of languages. <i>KL</i> = {<i>wu</i> : <i>w</i> &#8714; <i>K</i> &#8743; <i>u</i> &#8714; <i>L</i>}, and the
reader can probably guess what K* is going to be. It's the union of <i>K</i>, <i>KK</i>, <i>KKK</i> . . .
</p>
<p>Exercise: If <i>K</i> = {<i>aa</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>bc</i>} and <i>L</i> = {<i>bb</i>, <i>ac</i>, <i>ab</i>} what are (i) <i>KL</i>, (ii) <i>LK</i>, (iii) <i>KK</i>, (iv) <i>LL</i>?<br><br>

<p>Exercise: Can you express |<i>KL</i>| in terms of |<i>K</i>| and |<i>L</i>|?<br><br>

<p>The following fact is fundamental.<br>
If <i>K</i> and <i>L</i> are regular languages so are <i>K</i> &#8745; <i>L</i>, <i>K</i> \ <i>L</i>, <i>KL</i> and <i>K</i>*.</p>
<p>So every language you can obtain from regular languages by means of any of the operations we have just seen is likewise regular.</p>
<p>Let's talk through this result.</p>

<h3><i>K</i> &#8745; <i>L</i></h3>
<p>The thought-experiment shows very clearly that the intersection of two regular
languages is regular : if I have a machine &#8499;<sub>1</sub> that recognises <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> and a machine &#8499;<sub>2</sub> that recognises <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> I obviously run them in parallel, giving each new
incoming character to both machines and accept a string if they both accept it.
Using the imagery of the thought-experiment, the clipboard of information that
I hand on to you when I go for my coffee break has become a pair of clipboards,
one for &#8499;<sub>1</sub> and one for &#8499;<sub>2</sub>.
</p><p>But although this makes it clear that the intersection of two regular lan-
guages is regular, it doesnâ€™t make clear what the machine is that recognises the
intersection. We want to cook up a machine &#8499;<sub>3</sub> such that we can see running-&#8499;<sub>1</sub>-and-&#8499;<sub>2</sub>-in-parallel as merely running &#8499;<sub>3</sub>. &#8499;<sub>3</sub> is a sort of composite of
&#8499;<sub>1</sub> and &#8499;<sub>2</sub>. What are the states of this new composite machine?</p>
<p>The way to see this is to recall  the idea that a state of a
machine is a state-of-knowledge about the string-seen-so-far. What state-of-
knowledge is encoded by a state of the composite machine? Obviously a state
of the composite machine must encode your knowledge of the states of the two
machines that have been composed to make the new (composite) machine. So
states of the composite machine are ordered pairs of states of &#8499;<sub>1</sub> and &#8499;<sub>2</sub>.
</p><p>What is the state transition function for the new machine? Suppose &#8499;<sub>1</sub> has a transition function &#948;<sub>1</sub> and &#8499;<sub>2</sub> has a transition function &#948;<sub>2</sub>, then the
new machine has the transition function that takes the new state &#12296;<i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>&#12297; and a
character <i>c</i> and returns the new state &#12296;&#948;<sub>1</sub>(<i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i>), &#948;<sub>2</sub>(<i>s</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>c</i>)&#12297;.</p>

<h3><i>K</i>&#8746;<i>L</i> and <i>K</i> \ <i>L</i></h3>
<p>The proofs that a union or difference of two regular languages is regular is
precisely analogous.</p>
<p>People sometimes talk of the <i>complement</i> of a language <i>L</i>. <i>L</i> is a language
over an alphabet &#931;, and its complement, relative to &#931;, is &#931;* \ <i>L</i>. It's easy to see
that the complement of a regular language <i>L</i> is regular: if we have a machine
&#8499; that recognises <i>L</i>, then we can obtain from it a machine that recognises the
complement of <i>L</i> just by turning all accepting states into non-accepting states
and vice versa.</p>
<p>(A common mistake is to assume that every subset of a regular language
is regular. I think there must be a temptation to assume that a subset of a
language recognised by &#8499; will be recognised by a version of &#8499; obtained by
throwing away some accepting states.)
</p>

<h3><i>KL</i></h3>
<p>It's not obvious that the concatenation of two regular languages is regular, but
it's plausible. We will explain this later. For the moment we will take it as read
and press ahead. This leads us to . . .</p>
