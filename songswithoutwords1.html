Toreador<br>

To be sung of course to the obvious melody from <i>Carmen</i>.  Wolf
thought that Wagner had perfected the art of setting words to music.
Curious that, when you reflect that it was Wolf himself who perfected
the art, while Wagner of course never wrote any music at all (tho' his 
libretti are better than the 19th century average and he was a decent 
art theorist and philosopher in the German Idealist style&mdash;if that 
isn't an oxymoron). A harder art still, one might think, is to fit 
words to a pre&euml;xisting melody, which is what Ira Gershwin 
apparently did to George's melodies and Michael Flanders famously did 
to one of Mozart's horn concerti&mdash;and what our anonymous Master of 
the Cuspidors does here.  <br> I include this text here because&mdash;it 
seems to me&mdash;the way in which the last line fits the melody is, quite 
simply, <i>perfect</i>.  It is worthy of Wolf.  There is no higher praise.
