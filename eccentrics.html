<p>Never trust a man who, when left alone in a room with a tea-cosy, doesn't try it on.

While we are on this subject, we should reflect that <i> real</i> eccentrics never think they're eccentrics, they always think they're mainstream; if you <i> think</i> you are an eccentric then
you are merely a <i> poseur</i>.   After all, why would you <i>not</i> try on a tea-cosy?
<br>
I think the point is not that eccentrics are mistaken about where the <i>mean</i> lies; they are mistaken about the <i>standard deviation</i>.  They think they are one standard deviation from the mean when they are in fact ten.

Is there a point to be made about Englishness here?  I remember seeing Bu&ntilde;uel
giving an interview to a French TV journalist, and talking about the Theatre of the Absurd. The
interviewer asked him why the English did not seem to have a Theatre of the Absurd; Bu&ntilde;uel replied:
<p>``Les Anglais n'en ont pas besoin; ils <i>sont</i> absurde!''<p>
