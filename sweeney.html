<A HREF =https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Cresswell">Max Cresswell</A> is a distinguished senior colleague of mine and an old
friend. He is also a sucker for amateur opera and&mdash;if the following
(that he recited to me years ago, from some mercifully forgotten lost
operetta) is anything to go by&mdash;is cursed (as am i) with the ability
to remember doggerel:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm | evil as | evil as | evil can | be
<p>
	    (You can tell by the bar lines that it's in triple time)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	    I | don't think there's | anyone as | evil as | me!

	    <p>

	    is a patter song.  The barber (for it is he) also has the recitative
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	    I'm Sweeney Todd the Barber<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	    and Evil Thoughts I harbour<p>
	    
	    I'm not making this up, and i don't think Max made it up either.
