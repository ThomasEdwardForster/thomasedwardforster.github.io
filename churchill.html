<i>
….there can be no doubt that Socialism is inseparably interwoven
     with Totalitarianism and the abject worship of the
     State. …liberty, in all its forms is challenged by the
     fundamental conceptions of Socialism. …there is to be one State
     to which all are to be obedient in every act of their lives. This
     State is to be the arch-employer, the arch-planner, the
     arch-administrator and ruler, and the arch-caucus boss.
<p>
    A Socialist State once thoroughly completed in all its details and
    aspects… could not afford opposition. Socialism is, in its
    essence, an attack upon the right of the ordinary man or woman to
    breathe freely without having a harsh, clumsy tyrannical hand
    clapped across their mouths and nostrils.
<p>
    But I will go farther. I declare to you, from the bottom of my
    heart that no Socialist system can be established without a
    political police. Many of those who are advocating Socialism or
    voting Socialist today will be horrified at this idea. That is
    because they are shortsighted, that is because they do not see
    where their theories are leading them.
<p>
    No Socialist Government conducting the entire life and industry of
    the country could afford to allow free, sharp, or violently-worded
    expressions of public discontent. They would have to fall back on
    some form of <i>Gestapo</i>, no doubt very humanely directed in
    the first instance.

    And this would nip opinion in the bud; it would stop criticism as
    it reared its head, and it would gather all the power to the
    supreme party and the party leaders, rising like stately pinnacles
    above their vast bureaucracies of Civil servants, no longer servants
    and no longer civil. And where would the ordinary simple folk &mdash;
    the common people, as they like to call them in America &mdash; where
    would they be, once this mighty organism had got them in its grip?</i>

    This notorious speech has cast a long shadow.  I am a Labour voter
    at least in part because I grew up in a Labour-voting household.
    And my parents were labour voters at least in part because of this speech.
    And they weren't alone.
    
    My father was voting in his first UK general election in 1945
    (he'd been in Germany for the 1935 election) was one of many who
    heard this speech and decided that &mdash; whatever else he was
    going to do &mdash; he wasn't going to vote for the party headed
    by the man who came out with this stuff.  To someone like my
    father &mdash; who had lived in Hitler's Germany and seen
    book-burnings, and then returned to live in Britain under a
    coalition government with Clem Atlee as deputy PM &mdash; this
    kind of talk is not only profoundly offensive but also
    breathtakingly ignorant and stupid.  You cannot possibly vote for
    anyone who comes out with this kind of drivel.  Clem Atlee running
    the Gestapo?  Get real; get a <i>clue</i>. There is a lot that can
    be said along the lines of Churchill The Great War Leader and much
    of it is true.  But he was also an unrepentant imperialist and
    class warrior and this stuff we see above is not something anybody
    made him say.  This is what he actually thought.  And it is fair
    to judge him for it: you can fairly judge people by the choices
    they freely make. And this is what he chose to say. Admire the war
    leader by all means, but don't forget this speech.  My father
    didn't. And we shouldn't.  <p> Incredibly there are are still
    people who quote this text with approval.  I found the full text
    on a site called hosted by an organisation with the
    innocent-sounding title <A HREF="https://www.aei.org/">``The
    American Enterprise Institute''</A>.  One can only assume that
    none of them have been to Scandinavia, or enjoyed the benfits of
    socialised medicine.  Churchill did not have a monopoly of any of
    the vices on display here, and the supply of dickheads is
    inexhaustible; some facts about the human condition never change.
