	Dicis enim ut in domo habitans quilibet, si materiam eius et 
compositionem quantitatem et qualitatem ignoret, tali hospicio dignus 
non est, ita si qui in aula mundi natus atque educatus tam mirande 
pulcritudinis rationem scire negligat, post discretionis annos indignus 
atque si fiere posset eiciendus est.<hr>

Adelard of Bath<hr>


<p> Roughly: if you do not make a serious effort to understand the
rational beauty of this world into which you are born you do not
deserve to live in it.<br> The cultural context in which this remark
was made was one in which it was considered almost impious to try to
predict or understand anything because God could perform a miracle at
any moment without notice.  (Did the people who thought this think
that Eve was a bad precedent, an Awful Caution?).  This idea, 
 that it is our reverent duty, as God's creatures (creature = created-thing) to
attempt to understand His Creation, was radical and &mdash; one would have thought &mdash;
quite disruptive; indeed &mdash;
 as one of my mediaevalist colleagues pointed out &mdash;  it is actually
quite striking that Adelard wasn't roundly told off for it and packed off to a 12th century equivalent of Siberia...  perhaps Bath was such a place already so no further steps were required....  One might
well wonder where it comes from. It seems to be Islamic, or at least
to have reached us <i> via </i> Islam.  Certainly at Adelard's time
(12th century) Europe was beginning to emerge from the Dark Ages
(wonderfully described by Russell in his <i> History of Western Philosophy </i>
as an age ``exceeding all others in cruelty and superstition'') as a
result of exposure to Classical and Islamic learning coming out of
Spain. <br>

(By the way I have never known whether the <b> Dark Ages </b> are so-called because
we have very little information about them, or because they were A Dark Time.
Perhaps some kind person can tell me..?)
<hr>
Incidentally did any of you notice that the Dark Ages were alluded to in
<b> dark letters</b>?!  I can't help it; i'm a logician &mdash; deal with it.<hr>
