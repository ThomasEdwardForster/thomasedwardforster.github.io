I am collecting here all the information retrievable from the web
concerning the family of my paternal grandfather, Leonard Williams,
after whom my father (Leonard Forster) was named and who was his
godfather. (There is a form in these matters!)  I am doing this in the
hope that some other descendent of Dewi Heli and Anna Loveday who is
trawling the web for information about them will stumble upon this
site and will be moved to supply me with information not available to
me.  There is reason to believe that Leonard Forster was not the only
irregular offspring of LLBW and I would be glad to know about any
others!

This comes from the on-line DNB:

   The Laurence Gotch who married his daughter seems to be Gotch
junior of Gotch Saunders & Surridge.  Laurence Gotch had at least one
son.

Alice Helen Alexandra Williams was born in Castle Deudraeth, Wales, in
1863, the youngest daughter of David Williams MP. During the First
World War, she worked for the French Wounded Emergency Fund and helped
set up the Signal Bureau in Paris to give advice to those searching
for the injured, the missing and refugees. For this work, the French
government subsequently awarded her the Medaille de la Reconnaissance
Francaise. During the war, she was keen supporter of the Women's
Institute movement, became the president of the Deudraeth group and
contributed to the building of the first institute hall at
Penrhyndeudraeth through a donation of land and fundraising. Women's
Institutes had begun in the early part of the century for rural women
under the influence of the Agricultural Organisations' Society. During
the war, they had come under the control of the Board of Agriculture,
until 1918 when their care was passed to a Central Committee of the
new National Federation of Women's Institutes. Williams was elected
first to this as the Honorary Secretary and then to the Executive
Committee which superseded it in October of that year. When this
position was abolished to make way for that of paid General Secretary,
Williams once more took the role until she resigned to devote more
time to her other position of founding editor of its journal, Home and
Country in October of the following year. She retired as editor in
1920. In addition to her work with the Women's Institute, she was also
responsible for the foundation of branches of the Lyceum Club in
Berlin and Paris. In 1919 she was the founder and the first chair of
the Forum Club in London. She was also a painter in watercolours and a
member of the Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs in Paris and of
the Union Internationale des Aquerellistes. Additionally, she was a
writer specialising in poetry with a number of published plays and
pageants such as 'Aunt Mollie's Story' (1913), 'Britannia' (1917),
'Britain Awake: An Empire Pageant Play' (1932) and 'Gossip'
(1935). She was made a bard under the name of Alys Meirion in 1917 and
received a CBE in 1937. She died on the 15th August 1957, aged 94.
