To be lectured in Lent 2016.  Dates and times still to be arranged

<A HREF ="logicforlinguists.pdf"> Here </A> are the notes from which I
will be lecturing this course.  [They are work-in-progress as I write
this, in the long vac, so there is little point in downloading them
before the start of term]. In any case readers should bear in mind
that they are <i>lecture notes</i> and are not proper
tested-on-animals
<i>course materials</i>.  I have written out those things that I fear
I might omit in the hurry of a live performance; I have written out
also - in some cases in considerable detail - those things that I
suspect I might get wrong.  Material that I know I can do standing on
my head is reduced to mere bullet points.  Accordingly access to these
notes is not an entirely adequate substitute for taking your own
notes: indeed there will be a small prize for the best set of notes taken!

<hr>
If your college is willing to pay for supervisions I will be happy to offer them.

I supply links to two files which overlap these notes.<hr>

<b>(1)</b>
<A HREF ="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/chchlectures.pdf"> Lecture Notes on Logic for Philosophy Students</A>.

Much of the importance of Logic for Philosophy comes from the lessons
it has to teach us about <i>reasoning</i>; in contrast we are
interested in it for what it has to tell us about <i>language</i>.  So
the material therein concerning rules of inference, validity
<i>etc.</i> are likely to be of limited interest.  However, the semantics is
important.

<b>(2)</b> Readers may also find useful Chlo&euml; Brown's html
version of my 1a Computer Science Tripos <A HREF
="langs-and-automata/main.html"> Regular Languages and Finite
Automata </A> notes.  Answers to the exercises are supplied in links
that you can click on once you have done the exercises.  <hr>

Finally, here are <A HREF ="crouchnotes.pdf"> Richard Crouch's Notes on
Languages and Automata </A>.  <p> Crouch's notes are designed for
computer science students, and as a result are probably more
mathematical and generally unforgiving than a linguistics student (who
after all may well be a humanities student!)  would like.  Basically
the only reason why they are here is that he is a mate of mine and
they are free!
