<p>

I used to be asleep, you know<br>
with blankets on my bed.<br>
I lay there for a while<br>
till they discovered I was dead. <p>
The coroner was friendly<br>
I liked him quite a lot<br>
If i hadn'o bin a woman...<br>
I guess i'd never have bin caught<p>
They gave me back my house and car<br>
And nothing more was said...<hr>
