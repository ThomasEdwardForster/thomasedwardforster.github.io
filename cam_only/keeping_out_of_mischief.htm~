<h2 align="center">A solution to The Handshake Problem<br>
by Gary Jackson - ODL Student Cohort 14</h2>

<h3><u>The Problem</u></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Hilary and Jocelyn are married. They invite four
couples for dinner, who all arrive at once. Handshakes all round, well almost
all round, because nobody shakes hands with themselves or their partner. Later,
Jocelyn asks everyone else how many hands they have shaken and everyone gives a
different answer.</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is :- How many hands has Hilary shaken?</b></p>

<h3><u>The Solution</u></h3>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly we need to determine the entire list
of answers given to Jocelyn. This is simple. The maximum number of
people a person could shake hands with is 8. Remember there are 10
people who can shake hands and you do not shake with yourself or your
partner, so you are left with 8.  If Jocelyn asks 9 people then the
nine different answers must be {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.  (1 is of
course the person who shook only one hand, 2 is the person who shook
two hands etc etc).  The ten people can then be represented by using a
graph with 
{J, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} the set of nodes, where J is
Jocelyn (Graph 1) .</b></p> <p align="center"><b><img border="0"

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest can be determined by a simple
process of elimination. We start with 8 (the person who shook hands
with eight people). 8 could not have shaken hands with 0 as nobody
could have shaken hands with the person who shook no hands! This means
there can only be 8 other people whom 8 shook with. These 'shakes' are
represented on the graphs as edges. Note these edges are 2 way (i.e. 8
shakes with J so J must have shook with 8) and I have omitted the
arrows for simplicities sake.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="center"><b><img border="0" src="img_2.GIF" width="452" height="400"></b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we can see that the shaking was (8, J),
(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7). This leaves us
with 8 and 0 who have not shaken hands, and this gives us our first
couple. We now move onto 7. 7 has shaken with 8 already and will be
able to shake a further 6 hands. 7 cannot shake with 1 as 8 has
already done it and thereby used up 1's sole handshake</b></p>

<p align="center"><b><img border="0" src="img_3.GIF" width="452" height="400"></b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional shaking here was (7, J), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6). The only other person 7 has not shaken with is 1,
which gives us our next
couple. (Remember that 8 and 0 are
all ready accounted for ).</b></p>


<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 has already shaken with 8 and 7 so will be
able to shake a further 4 hands. This time 1 and 2 have already had
their allotted shakes.</b></p>


<p align="center"><b><img border="0" src="img_4.GIF" width="452" height="400"></b></p>


<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6's additional shaking was (6, J), (6, 3), (6,
4), (6, 5). From this we can determine, as we have done with 8-0 and
7-1,&nbsp; that 6-2 are our 3rd couple.</b></p>



<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 has already shaken with 8, 7 and 6 so is only
able to shake a further 2 hands. This time 1, 2 and 3 have already had
their allotted shakes.</b></p>



<p align="center"><b><img border="0" src="img_5.GIF" width="452" height="400"></b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5's extra shaking was (5, J) and (5 ,4). From this
we see that 3 is the partner of 5. This then only leaves us with J and
4, and we have now accounted for every handshake.  So 4 must be
Hilary, the spouse of J. In other words 4 is the number of hands that
Hilary has shaken.</b></p>
