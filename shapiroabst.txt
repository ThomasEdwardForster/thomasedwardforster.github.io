I consider the raging issue concerning the extent to which is it 
possible to rigorously prove (or disprove) that a function is 
computable if and only if it is recursive.  It makes for an 
interesting case study for the relationship between formal and 
informal proof, and for the relationship between mathematics and 
non-mathematical reality.  I examine the extent to which Friedrich 
Waismann's notion of open texture applies to mathematics, using Imre 
Lakatos's thesis of proofs and refutations, and his historical 
examples, as a backdrop.  The ramifications for the philosophical 
understanding of Church's thesis are then examined.
