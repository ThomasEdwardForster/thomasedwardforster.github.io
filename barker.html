(you have to read it aloud in a fake chinese accent)
<hr>....except
that of course Confucius never said anything like it.  It's the Two
Ronnies.<p> What fascinates and disquiets me about it is the way in
which&mdash;despite the fact that it doesn't mean anything&mdash;it nevertheless 
<i> sounds very much</i> like lots of things are <i> widely believed</i> 
to mean <i> a great deal</i>.  It reminds me, in its niggling way, that 
much of what passes for philosophy and theology is in fact entirely 
content-free, and gets accepted as Philosophy or Theology purely in 
virtue of ticking the right linguistic boxes.<p>
You'll sometimes hear analytic philosophers complain about continental
philosophy after this fashion (''squishy stuff'') as well, but don't let
them try to tell you they're any different. They lard their discourse with
lexical items such as ``truth conditions'' and ``rigid designators'' &mdash;
and what in God's name is a <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthmaker_theory">
<i> truthmaker</i>?? </A>  Sounds like something out of <A HREF ="lewis.html">
C.S. Lewis </A>.... <i>Voyage of the Truthmaker</i>...?
Or were they a 1970s Christian Band <i> The Truthmakers</i>...? Actually The <i>Rigid Designator</i> is a High Official of some kind in a sex cult. All these
things are just props in an elaborate language game, bearing no meaning whatever.
<p>As Quine once said ``scepticism begins at home''... so perhaps i'm talking bollocks all the time too...(?)
<p>
But then perhaps it really <i>does</i> mean something&mdash;just as it sounds as if it ought.. and we (and even Ronnie Barker!) don't know what it is...?
