``Much the most important thing that happened to me at Campbell [his
prep school] was that I there read <A HREF ="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43604/sohrab-and-rustum"><i>Sohrab and Rustem</i></A> ....  I
loved the poem at first sight and have loved it ever since. As the wet
fog, in the first line, rose out of the Oxus stream, so out of the
whole poem there rose and wrapped me round an exquisite silvery
coolness, a delightful quality of distance and calm, a grave
melancholy.  I hardly appreciated then, as I have since learned to,
the central tragedy; what enchanted me was the artist in Pekin with
his ivory forehead and pale hands, the cypress in the Queen's garden,
the backward glance at Rustem's youth, the pedlars from Khabul, the
hushed Chorasmian waste.  Arnold gave me at once [...] a sense, not
indeed of passionless vision, but of a passionate, silent gazing at
things a long way off.  And here observe how literature actually
works. Parrot critics say that <i>Sohrab</i> is a poem for classicists
to be enjoyed only by those who recognise the Homeric echoes.
But I ... knew nothing of Homer.  For me the relation worked
the other way; when I came, years later, to read the <i>Iliad</i> I
liked it partly because it was reminiscent of <i>Sohrab.   Plainly
it does not matter at what point you first break into the system of
European poetry.  Only keep your ears open and your mouth shut and
everything will lead you to everything else in the end.''</i>

[My italics].  I was made to read the <i> Screwtape Letters</i> when i
was at boarding school.  (My school was a Anglican school so that sort
of thing was to be expected). I was repelled by it.  (I probably still
would be: the Inklings were eminently dislikable)....I think what
annoyed me was the <i>smugness</i> &mdash; C.S. Lewis is a writer of
exemplary smugness &mdash; born of a certainty that he could evade
situations where his assumptions would be challenged by his
intellectual equals.  He must have been an unmitigated pain in the
arse. If you find Dawkins irritating, just read a few pages of
C.S. Lewis and you will see why Dawkins is necessary.  However there
is some good in all of us and years later i was rewarded by the
discovery of the above gem..<br> <p> He may have been a pain, but he
was a scholar. (We even see a little bit of humility in the quoted text...not much, God knows, but <i>some</i>)
