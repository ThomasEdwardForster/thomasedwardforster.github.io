``Two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was <i>Civis romanus sum</i>. 
Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is ``Ich bin ein Berliner!"... All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words "Ich bin ein Berliner!" ''

<hr>

That was then; <i>now</i> the proudest boast is ``I am a Kiwi''.

New Zealand has the two most beautiful islands in the world, the 
world's best honey, the world's second-best chips, our best wine 
is as good as any in the world, and our best cheese is not bad 
either. New Zealand&mdash;the world's smallest cricketing nation&mdash;has 
just beaten the world's biggest cricketing nation to be World Champions.  
NZ has no COVID, and has a <i>majority Labour Government</i> for heavan's sake.
  The Prime Minister, the Head of State, 
the Leader of the Opposition, the head of the Secret Service,
and the Lord Chief Justice are all women.  Our parliament has the 
highest proportion of LGBTQ members of any in the world.  R***rt M****ch's media empire has no footprint in NZ, and that is almost certainly hugely important. 
<p>It's a
 civilised country.

I always had the idea that having an NZ passport <i>might</i> one day save 
my life. The tho'rt was that i might be on a plane that was hijacked 
by Islamist nutters, who would presumably murder all the Brits and  Yanks 
but might&mdash;just <i>might</i>&mdash;not murder the Kiwis.  That sounded like 
such a good idea that Mossad caught on and started issuing forged NZ 
passports to its agents, which rather spoiled the effect.<br>
But it saved my life anyway, co's it got me back to NZ in March 2020.
