Title:  Nonstandard Models of Fragments of Church's Type Theory

Abstract:

We use logical relations to construct combinatory frames which model
fragments of Church's type theory.  The frames will not generally
realize all the logical constants of Church's type theory and
consequently will not satisfy the full set comprehension principles.
In particular, we will define a combinatory frame in which a
form of Cantor's theorem is false.  This frame also has interesting
properties with respect to the cardinality of domains at power types.
