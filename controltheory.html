Control theory ought to underlie analog computing the way Logic
underlies digital computing.  The fact that humans are capable of
digital reasoning and yet run as analog machines tells us that there
must be a connection between the two, at least at the level where our
digital thought processes are implemented as ion flows.

<p>
At present John Lygeros is talking about Control theory in an
introductory way for those of us who either have forgotten all our
analysis or never knew any in the first place.  The present long-term
aim of the group is to understand some results in the theory of
differential games.

<p>
We meet in the discussion room in the Computer Laboratory on alternate
tuesdays at 4pm. (6/ii, 20/ii, 6/iii ...)
