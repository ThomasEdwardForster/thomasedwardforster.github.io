<p> I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the Luddite cropper,
the `obsolete' hand-loom weaver, the `utopian' artisan&mdash;and even the
deluded follower of Joanna Southcott&mdash;from the enormous condescension
of posterity.  Their crafts and traditions may have been dying; their
hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking;
their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies; their
insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. . . . . but they
lived through these times of acute social disturbance <i>and we did not</i>.

E.P. Thompson.  The Making of the English Working Class. Penguin 1968 
p. 13. (my punctuation).   Surely of all the many warnings against doing Whig 
History this is the most sobering&mdash;and the most moving.  Before you judge anyone, walk a mile in their shoes.

Thompson was a Marxist, God bless 'im.  He may have been wrong about a lot of things, but there are times when it is more noble to be wrong than to be right, and this is one of them.
