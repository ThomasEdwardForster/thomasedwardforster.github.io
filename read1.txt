Abstract:
WITTGENSTEIN AND ZEN: AN INTERNAL RELATION
 Previous attempts by Western philosophers to connect Wittgenstein with Zen
Buddhism (e.g. by Canfield) have in the main simply been ignored, ridiculed
(e.g. by Hacker) or intelligently yet in the end unsympathetically
critiqued (e.g. by Phillips). I wish to consider sympathetically the
inclination to find real commonalities between Wittgenstein and Buddhism.
To do so, it is necessary to look deeper at/for those commonalities than
Canfield or even Garfield do.
 I submit that the logic of 'throwing away the ladder' and of 'leaeving
everything as it is' are logics that have precise antecedents in Buddhism,
especially in Zen. I focus especially on parallels between Wittgenstein's
'metaphilosophy', both early and late, and the writings and sayings of
Dogen and of Shunryu Suzuki.
