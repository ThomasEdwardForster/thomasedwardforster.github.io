We<br>
 want a wee<br>
 want a wee<br>
 want a wee<br>
<p>
If you won't let us<br>
we'll do it on your bus

Anon:  Australian schoolchildren's chant to annoy the driver of the school bus.
Told  me by an Australian called Peter Johnston (?spelling) in about 1980.
<hr><hr>

I hadn't intended this to happen, but as a result of my posting this wee 
ditty here I have been sent a few more offerings, both from the back of buses
in New Zealand:
 <p>

The Boontown boys are on the piss again, <br>
on the piss again <br>
the Boontown boys are on the piss again, <br> 
we want a wee wee now! <br>
 <p>
we want a wee wee now! <br>
we want a wee wee now! <br>
the Boontown boys are on the piss again, <br>
we want a wee wee now! <br>
<p> and  (to the tune of ``we were only playing leapfrog''): <p>

Stop the bus i want a wee wee <br>
Stop the bus i want a wee wee <br>
Stop the bus i want a wee wee <br>
A wee wee packet of chips!<br>

(NZ-ers often use to word `chips' to cover crisps as well as chips)<hr>
Thanks for those, but please don't send me any more!!
