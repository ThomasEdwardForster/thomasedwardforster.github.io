It is said that if you kiss the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blarney_Stone"> Blarney stone </A>
you get the gift of the blarney.
Indeed it is even said that that if you merely kiss
<i>someone who has kissed the Blarney stone</i> then you, too, get the gift.
(The stuff the Irish come up with, i mean <i>really</i> ....).  

 <p> The story is told of the giddy girl who challenged with this
intelligence an irish priest who
was said to have kissed the stone&mdash;hoping for a reaction&mdash;and got the
reply <p>``I'm afraid not, my dear, for i have only <i>sat</i> on
it''.<p> Well, it evidently worked for him.  Or perhaps they learn
that kind of mental agility at their seminaries... a catholic
education must be good for <i>something</i>. I had a student once who
came from Blarney but i would probably be in breach of my duty of
confidentiality if i told you who she was.  And i certainly never
tried to kiss her, then or later .... but perhaps i should have done,
or at least got her to sit on me.  <hr> Click here for <A HREF
