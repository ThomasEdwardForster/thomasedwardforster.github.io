Ich hab's ja selbst so gewollt:<br>
"Einmal vor Unerbittlichem stehen,<br>
Wo keines Mutter sich nach uns umsieht,<br>
Kein Weib unsern Weg kreuzt,<br>
Wo nur die Wirklichkeit herrscht, Grausam und gro√ü."<br>
Ich war ganz besoffen davon.<br>
Das ist jetzt die Wirklichkeit."<br>

They say that <i>Das Boot</i> is possibly the greatest war film ever
made.  I know one should rank things in this way, but the ranking can
be an effective attention-getting device, and this film is,
well.... pretty damn good.  I know nothing about this text (which i 
heard in the film) beyond the name of the author&mdash;who seems to 
be a Basler like my mother, but a schwob nevertheless.  It's a highlight 
selected by one of the sailors, who is seriously expecting to die, and 
he's selected the bit that matters.  The rest of the poem looks pretty 
dire, actually.  <p>

Novels often contain useful circumstantial information.  We are never
told in so many words in what language the conversations in the book
are conducted, but the names are all German, and best bet must be that
the language was too.  Rassendyll seems to have no difficulty, and
indeed he wouldn't be able to get away with the ``play-acting'' if his
German was not near-native.  Hope Hawkins doesn't seem to think that
Rassendyll's fluency in German needs any explanation in 1893.  And
indeed it doesn't. Both my British grandparents spoke fluent German
(and my grandfather was almost the same age as Rassendyll, being in
fact two years older).  Educated Brits of that generation spoke
German.
