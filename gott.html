<hr>
``People talk of him as if he were a Scarlet Pimpernel, but <i> he is
actually doing no more than one would expect of the representative of 
a rich and civilised people that have a government that knows the 
difference between right and wrong</i>.''

[<i>my italics</i>]<br>
Doesn't seem much to ask when you put it like that.<p>
At the time of the Pinochet coup 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gott">Richard Gott</A> was reporting for the Guardian 
and <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Edelstam">Harald Edelstam</A> 
was the Swedish ambassador in Santiago de Chile. Edelstam
played a major r&ocirc;le in spiriting out of the country people who had much to fear from the attentions of 
the Pinochistas.  <p>

This phrase in Gott's despatch struck me greatly at the time, and the name 
`Edelstam' stuck in my mind too.  (Surely that word must mean something like 
`noble root'?) I have never forgotten either of them, and i am quoting this 
text from memory &mdash;
after more than fifty years.   It may not always be easy to <i>do</i> the right thing, 
but Gott is right: it can sometimes be very easy to see what the right thing 
is to do.
