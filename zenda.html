Somehow love gives even to a dull man the knowledge of his loverâ€™s heart.
I had come to humble myself and pray pardon for my presumption; but what
I said now was:<br>
``I love you with all my heart and soul!''

<hr>

I was made to read this pretty ghastly tale at school.  OK, it's not
as terrible as one sometimes thinks (tho' its understanding of
inheritance of hair colour is pretty slack, even for 1893) and it does
make one rather good point.  The quoted passage comes when Rassendyll
sees Flavia for the first time after she has learnt of the trick that
has been played on her.  Rassendyll has courted her while pretending
to be the King, and she has fallen in love with him, as he with her.
She has been deceived and lied to in matters that touch her as closely
as can be.  It really doesn't get much worse than this. Rassendyll has
some explaining to do(!)  But actually he doesn't need to explain
anything.  He tells her the <i>one</i> thing that really <i>really</i>
matters.  He tells her that he loves her.
<p>

There is a tendency to worry too much, on the big occasions, about
what one should say.  But Rassendyll is right, and there really is
nothing to worry about:
<p> <i> If you are serious, you will know what to say.</i>

I have just found a similar piece of business in a Ruth Rendell; i
won't tell you which co's i don't want to spoil it for you.
Rendell's reworking of this idea is of course much more subtle and
humanly plausible &mdash; as well as being much darker .. <i>much</i>
darker... Actually it quite upset me. (Mere murders i can deal with
&mdash; i quite like a good murder in fact .... but this is <i> much
</i> worse). Ruth Rendell is appallingly wonderful.  What a master.

Novels often contain useful circumstantial information.  We are never
told in so many words in what language the conversations in the book
are conducted, but the names are all German, and best bet must be that
the language was too.  Rassendyll seems to have no difficulty with
the ``play-acting'' &mdash; as Henzau calls it &mdash; and he wouldn't have been able to get away with it
had his German not been near-native.  Hope Hawkins doesn't seem to think that
Rassendyll's fluency in German needs any explanation in 1893.  And
indeed it doesn't. Both my British grandparents spoke fluent German
(and my grandfather was almost the same age as Rassendyll, being in
fact two years older).  Educated Brits of that generation spoke German.
