<hr>



There's no mystery about what's powering the expansion of the
universe: it's the mutual repulsion of paired socks.  Everyone knows
<i>that</i>.  It's a universal phenomenon of course, but is best seen
with the particle accelerator that one finds in every home, namely a
washing machine.  You put a pair of socks in it and after the
particles have accelerated and decelerated one sock is found to have
been ejected.  Maybe it's a version of the twin paradox.  <hr>
Incidentally the <i> uniform nature of the expansion</i> of the
universe (the rate of expansion seems to be the same everywhere, down
to the limits of measurement) strongly suggests that socks are
uniformly distributed.  Since socks are artefacts created exclusively
by intelligent life, it follows that intelligent life is quite
widespread in the universe---and fairly uniformly distributed.  There
is a simple inverse relation between Hubble's constant and your
expected distance to the closest inhabited planet.  The calculation is
quite hard, since it relies on various quantities that are poorly
constrained (it is not known, for example, whether or not the force
experienced by the socks decays over large distances with the same
inverse square law that it obeys over short distances) but the
closest-distance parameter seems to be of the order of hundreds of
parsecs.  <hr> Currently, at least!  It is interesting, in this
context, to note that subtle measurements suggest that Hubble's
constant is increasing over time.  Since this means that the number of
socks is increasing over time, it suggests that new advanced
civilisations are appearing faster than old ones die or blow
themselves up.  This is an encouraging reflection!  <hr> I have been
wondering recently..... how confident can we be that the gravitational
wobbles that LIGO is picking up are really merging black holes..?  My
friend Keith, at the farm, says that supernovas are always the result
of a centipede incautiously putting an entire set of socks into the
washing machine at one go instead of staggering the load. That's the
kind of mistake you can only make once.
