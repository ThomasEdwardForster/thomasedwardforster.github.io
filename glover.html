<p>
Now let my thoughts be like the Arrow, wherein was gold<br>
and purposeful like the Kawerau, but not so cold<p>
Let them sweep higher than the hawk ill-omened<br>
higher than peaks perspective-piled beyond Ben Lomond<br>
Let them be like at evening an Otago sky<br>
where detonated clouds in calm confusion lie
<p>

These are all Central Otago places. (Glover i think was making a point
about being a dinkum Kiwi). <br>  I bet the bloody tourists who clutter the
place now don't know this poem.
