<p>


There are certain thing&mdash;as, a spider, a ghost<br>
The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three&mdash;<br>
That I hate, but the thing that I Hate the most<br>
Is a thing they call the Sea<br>

<p>

Pour some salt water over the floor<br>
Ugly I'm sure you'll allow it to be;<br>
Suppose it extended a mile or more;<br>
<i>That's</i> very like the  Sea <br>
 <p>
Beat a dog 'till it howls outright<br>
Cruel, but all very well for a spree <br>
Suppose that he did so day and night&mdash;<br>
<i>That</i> would be like the Sea <br>

 <p>
I had a vision of nursery-maids <br>
Tens of thousands passed by me <br>
All leading children with wooden spades <br>
And this was by the Sea
<p>
Who invented these spades of wood? <br>
Who was it cut them out of the tree? <br>
None, I think, but an idiot could&mdash;<br>
Or one who loved the Sea <p>
It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float <br>
With `thoughts as boundless and souls as free': <br>
But, suppose you are very unwell in a the boat <br>
How do you like the Sea? <p>

There is an insect that people avoid <br>
(Whence is derived the verb `to flee') <br>
Where have you been by it most annoyed? <br>
In lodgings by the Sea.
<p>

If you like your coffee with sand for dregs <br>
A decided hint of salt in your tea <br>
And a fishy taste in the very eggs <br>
By all means choose the Sea<p>
And if, with these dainties to drink and eat <br>
You prefer not a vestige of grass or tree <br>
And a chronic state of wet in your feet <br>
Then&mdash;I recommend the Sea
<p>
For <i>I</i> have friends who dwell by the coast- <br>
Pleasant friends they are to me <br> 
It is when I am with them I wonder most<br>
That anyone likes the Sea.<p>
They take me a walk; though tired and stiff <br>
to climb the heights I madly agree <br>
And, after a tumble or so from the cliff, <br>
They kindly suggest the Sea<p>
I try the rocks, and I think it cool <br>
That they laugh with such an excess of glee <br>
As I heavily slip into every pool <br>
That skirts the cold, cold Sea <br>
