Here are my <A HREF ="cam_only/ODL116.html">Discrete Mathematics
course materials for Queen Mary</A> in html format.  Of course some of
the figures don't come out properly so it might be handy to have the
same stuff <A HREF ="cam_only/ODL116coursemat.pdf"> in .pdf
format. </A> 

Here are some <A HREF ="cam_only/discex.pdf"> Discrete maths exercises
</A> and here are some <A HREF ="cam_only/discexanswers.pdf">
answers. </A>
 
<p>Here are my  <A HREF ="cam_only/ODL112.pdf">  Queen Mary notes on Languages and Automata.  </A> The may be useful to 1a's


<p> People doing Logic and Proof 1b might find the following files
useful. <br> Here are some notes on <A HREF ="cam_only/unification.pdf">
Unification </A>; here are some <A HREF="cam_only/LandPexercises.pdf">
exercises on Logic and Proof. </A>.  An answer file (containing
in addition discussions of a lot of Dr Paulson's exercises) is 
<A HREF="cam_only/LandPanswers.pdf"> here. </A><p>

My notes on

 <A HREF ="cam_only/foundFP.pdf"> 1b Foundations of Functional
Programming </A> contain discussions of tripos questions that have
probably scrolled off the radar (I haven't supervised this course for
a number of years).

<p> <A HREF ="cam_only/compsci_notes.pdf"> Here </A> are my
supervision notes for assorted CS topics.  They are messages to
myself, and come with no guarantees.  I am gradually pulling files out
of them to link individually from here.
