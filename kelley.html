``John Wehausen once told me <p><i>Every mathematician, for most of his early life, is the brightest person he knows, and it's a great shock when he finds that there are people who can easily do things that are very hard for him'</i>.  <p> I think that this is true, and that within every mathematician, more-or-less suppressed or laughed-at, is an arrogant little know-it-all.....and simultaneously a stricken child who has been found wanting.''<p>

Some of us never make that discovery... Russell wrote of his time in Cambridge...``
For a long time I supposed that somewhere in the university there were really 
clever people that I had not yet met, and whom I should at once recognise as 
my intellectual superiors, but during my second year I discovered that I 
already knew all the cleverest people in the university.  This was a great disappointment to me..''<hr>
