<p>

Fairest earth <br>
fount of life, giver of bodies <br>
deep well of our delight, breath of desire <br>
let us come to you <br>
barefoot, as befits love, as the boy to the trembling girl <br>
as the child to the mother <br>
seeking above all things the honesty of substance <br>
touch of soil and wind and rock <br>
frost and flower and water <br>
the honey of the senses, the food <br>
of love's imagining; and the most intimate <br>
touch of love, that turns to being; <br>
deriving wisdom, and the knowledge of necessity <br>
building thereon, stone by stone <br>
the rational architecture of truth, to house <br>
the holy flame, that is neither reason nor unreason <br>
but the thing given, <br>
the flame that burns blue in the stillness, hovering <br>
between the green wood of the flesh and the smoke of death <br>
 <br>
Fair earth, we have broken our idols; <br>
and after the days of fire we shall come to you <br> 
for the stones of a new temple. <br>

  A. R. D. Fairbairn <hr> 

Fairbairn wrote too much, as I complained in <A HREF ="poem9.html"> poem 19.html </A>. Even this one <br>
- tho' by no means half-baked - has a bit in the middle that didn't rise  <br>
properly.  Still, he has managed to write a good poem about materialism, <br>
 and I bet you didn't think that was possible!!


<hr>
Actually, thinking about it a bit more, later, i might edit this poem out of the chain, on the fashionable grounds that Fairbairn turns out not to have been quite as left-wing as poets of his generation should have been.  He was no friend of the Labour Government of 1935-49.  I think i'll cancel him.....
