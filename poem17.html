I thought I saw Jesus
<br>
on a tram.
<br>
I said ``Are you Jesus?''
<br>
He replied ``Yes I am''.

Was Milligan a believer?  I don't know.  I don't suppose the <br>
person who wrote this poem <i>has to</i> be a believer;  I'd've been <br> 
happy to have written it, and God knows I'm <A HREF ="lipton.html"> no believer</A>. <br> Perhaps it's the 
fact that we know it was written by Milligan <br> that makes it so poignant.
<p>
In any case, genuine religious observation can crop up in the most <br>
unexpected settings.  One of my students had a .signature file which <br>
contained the following observation of Lenny Bruce: "Just think, if <br> 
Jesus had lived and died in the twentieth century all those Christians <br>
would be wearing little electric chairs round their necks''.
