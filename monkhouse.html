They laughed when I said I wanted to be a stand-up comic.<br> [<i>Dramatic pause</i>]<br>  They're not laughing now!!<p>

The wonderful irony of this is that it's only beco's Monkhouse was such a <br> crap 
comic that this little sally is funny at all.  If a decent stand-up comic 
<br> tried to use  it it wouldn't raise a laugh.  Touch of the old Liar Paradox.<p>
