Bloody men are like bloody buses&mdash;<br>
You wait for about a year<br>
And as soon as one approaches your stop<br>
Two or three others appear.<br>

You look at them flashing their indicators,<br>
Offering you a ride.<br>
You're trying to read the destination,<br>
You haven't much time to decide.<br>
<p>
If you make a mistake, there is no turning back.<br>
Jump off, and you'll stand there and gaze<br>
While the cars and the taxis and lorries go by<br>
And the minutes, the hours, the days.<br>
