My lovely friend Jo, when a modern language student was packed off to
New Caledonia (the closest place where they spoke French) and fell in
with a local boy.  He wanted to go to bed with her of course (didn't
we all) but she couldn't make up her mind.  <br>As she tells the story,
he said to her&mdash;not unkindly&mdash;<p><i> Mais, ch&eacute;rie, il
faut savoir ce que tu pref&egrave;res</i>.<p>

If you don't know what you want, you are unlikely to get it.
