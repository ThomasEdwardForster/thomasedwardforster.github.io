	 Hollis </A> had a famously sharp tongue.  Very Oxonian. When
	 he turned up at the Philosophy department at UEA in my third
	 year as a student there he was the first person to be
	 appointed who wasn't Cambridge. He upset quite a lot of
	 people, but he was very talented, very professional and very
	 amusing.  He was also very hard on me.  I was a talented but
	 self-indulgent and undisciplined student who had been allowed to get
	 away with murder in my first two years.  I wrote essays that
	 were structureless streams of consciousness. They were
	 appalling, actually.  Martin roasted me alive, and quite
	 right too.  I still have my essays for him with his comments
	 on them.  Every now and then i get them out and look at
	 them&mdash;and Martin's comments&mdash;to remind myself that
	 i wasn't always the pillar of wisdom that I am&mdash;<i>of
	 course</i>&mdash;now.  I miss him, and i wish he were still
	 around so i could thank him<p>

There is an interesting question in philosophy of mind.  I can feel
pain in parts of my body that do not have nerve endings. Are these real
pains, or merely referred pains (where 'referred' is an alienating
adjective.) In Martin's philosophy of mind class at UEA, someone was
saying that these pains are genuine pains, and are not to be defaced
by having any alienating adjective slapped on them.  As my flatmate
Ivor reports it, Martin Hollis said <p><b>``Does that mean that
Professor Grice can feel a pain in his bicycle?'' </b> <p>(Russell
Grice&mdash;author of <i>The Grounds of Moral Judgement</i>&mdash;was
the head of department, and would commute by bike to and from his
house in College road just up the hill from Ivor and me).  <p> I think
the answer is probably `yes'.  There is a literature on how people
come to `own' prosthetic limbs... i'm not sure that they describe
themselves as feeling <i>pains</i> in those limbs, but they can come
to feel that they are part of their bodies... There are parallel
questions about proprioception rather than pain and then there is an
obvious parallel with Dawkins' idea of the <i>Extended Phenotype.</i>
