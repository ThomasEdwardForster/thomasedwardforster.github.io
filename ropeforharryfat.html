<p>

Oh some have killed in angry love
<br>And some have killed in hate,
<br>And some have killed in foreign lands
<br>To serve the business state.
<br>The hangman's hands are abstract hands
<br>Though sudden death they bring&mdash;
<br>"The hangman keeps our country pure,"
<br>Says Harry Fat the king.
<br>
<br>Young love will kick the chairs about
<br>And like a rush fire burn,
<br>Desiring what it cannot have,
<br>A true love in return.
<br>Who knows what rage and darkness fall
<br>When lovers' thoughts grow cold?
<br>"Whoever kills must pay the price,"
<br>Says Harry Fat the old.
<br>
<br>With violent hands a young man tried
<br>To mend the shape of life.
<br>This one used a shotgun
<br>And that one used a knife.
<br>And who can see our issues plain
<br>That vex our groaning dust?
<br>"The law is greater than the man,"
<br>Says Harry Fat the just.
<br>
<br>Te Whiu was too young to vote,
<br>The prison records show.
<br>Some thought he was too young to hang;
<br>Legality said No.
<br>Who knows what fear the raupo hides
<br>Or where the wild duck flies?
<br>"A trapdoor and a rope is best,"
<br>Says Harry Fat the wise.
<br>
<br>Though many a time he rolled his coat
<br>And on the bare boards lay,
<br>He lies in heavy concrete now
<br>Until the Reckoning Day.
<br>In linen sheet or granite aisle
<br>Sleep Ministers of State.
<br>"We cannot help the idle poor,"
<br>Says Harry Fat the great.
<br>
<br>Mercy stirred like a summer wind
<br>The wigs an polished boots
<br>And the long Jehovah faces
<br>Above their Sunday suits.
<br>The jury was uncertain;
<br>The judge debated long.
<br>"Let justice take her natural course,"
<br>Said Harry Fat the strong.
<br>
<br>The butcher boy and the baker boy
<br>Were whistling in the street
<br>When the hangman bound Te Whiu's eyes
<br>And strapped his hands and feet,
<br>Who stole to buy a bicycle
<br>And killed in panic blood.
<br>"The parson won his soul at length,"
<br>Said Harry Fat the good.
<br>
<br>Oh some will kill in rage and fear
<br>And some will kill in hate.
<br>And some will kill in foreign lands
<br>To serve the master State.
<br>Justice walks heavy in the land,
<br>She bears a rope and shroud.
<br>"We will not change our policy,"
<br>Says Harry Fat the proud.

This poem is one of the two things that i take away from the Dunedin
Festival to commemorate the death&mdash;well, the <i>life</i>, really&mdash;of
the then recently deceased <A HREF="poem5.html">Charles Brasch</A>, in
about 1974. For me a minor highlight was that it was one of the very
rare occasions that any music of mine has been publicly performed.
Rather more memorable, however, were the recitations of poems, two in
particular.  One was the Blind Poet <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._E._Middleton"> Ted Middleton </A> reciting the whole
of the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lament_for_the_Makaris">  Lament for the Makaris</A> &mdash;from memory of course, no
Braille crib no thank you.  <i>That's</i> not the kind of thing you forget in a
hurry. But the other was <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hone_Tuwhare"> Hone Tuwhare </A> reciting this wonderful angry
masterpiece of James K that we have before us.  <br> Te Whiu was an
actual person, a Maori hanged for murder, some time in the 1950's.
The 1935-49 Labour government had <i>inter alia</i> abolished capital
punishment, and the `National' (= conservative) government that came
into power in 1949 reinstated it (over the objections of some of its
own backbenchers, it must be said). This is the only case known
to me of a country restoring the death penalty after having abolished
it.  The case of Te Whiu was, well, you can tell from this poem what
it meant at the time.  For my money this is Baxter's best; poets are
always at their best when they have something to say. (There's a
statement of the obvious for you!)  <br> Anyway, Hone read this thing,
after which there was a stunned silence, broken eventually by
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegbert_Salomon_Prawer"> Siegbert
Prawer </A> (then visiting from Oxford) saying ``Would you read us some of
your own poetry, Mr Tuwhare?''.  Prawer didn't know the history (how
could he, after all) and he meant well, but it was an awkward moment.

Something the non-kiwi reader will not pick up (and which some of the
internet commentary on this poem misses) is the reference to the
character Harry.  Harry is the eponymous hero of a cycle of poems by
Denis Glover `Sings Harry' set to music by <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Lilburn"> Douglas Lilburn</A>.  I rather
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouDGBLy-U88"> like the
setting </A> (i like Lilburn generally in fact) tho' Jack Speirs
described the Glover settings as `an attempt to create a New Zealand
folk music from nonexistent sources' or words to that effect.  My
guess (and it's only a guess) is that Baxter (an angry young man when
he wrote this) probably thought of Glover as a soft-centred old piss
artist who should be kicked out of the way to make room for him, John
K Oxter, and others like him.  Glover's Harry figure is a happy-go-lucky
creature, clearly intended to be an iconic kiwi (a forerunner of
<A HREF="dagg.html">Fred Dagg</A> perhaps) and Baxter is not only taking
the piss out of Glover but making the point that the ordinary Kiwi is no
harry-go-lucky creature but a callous bugger who would hang Te Whiu
without a second thought.  Glover <i>was</i> a piss-artist,
it's true, but he was also a <A HREF="poem10.html ">decent poet</A>, and not a
rapist, as James K has recently been outed to be.

<p> I met Lilburn once.  Shy, gentle creature.  He lived in Ascot
terrace, (in Wellington) next door to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Paul"> Janet Paul </A> (who had been Glover's
lover).  She sent me to see him once (this was long after he had set
the <i>Sings Harry</i> cycle and Glover was long dead) : ``Introduce
yourself to him as a young composer''.  All i can remember him saying
to me was quoting Bach's advice on writing music: ``Write to the Glory
of God; anything written for any other reason is a hellish racket''.
I must track down the original German one day.  Bridie Lonie said he
was in love with Janet.  That could be true in some sense, but the
modern narrative has been commandeered by the Queer lobby, for whom he
was a hero, without a heterosexual bone in his ... well, <i>body</i>.
See <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Body"> Jack Body </A>(ha!) on this.  But he may be right of course.
