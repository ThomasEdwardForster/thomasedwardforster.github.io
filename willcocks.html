<hr>
The scene is King's Chapel, Cambridge, during a rehearsal for the annual carol concert, under the baton of Sir David Willcocks. 
The public are allowed in (I think this is still the case).  There are two mature Christian Ladies singing 
with devotion and energy but not, perhaps, perfect intonation.  At least not in the opinion of Sir David.  And they are perilously close to the choir and the microphones.
<hr>
He taps his baton on his lectern and approaches this delicate matter with all the tact he can muster, suggesting that the pair might like to sing more quietly or perhaps in tune, or, possibly (?) even <i>refrain from singing altogether!!(?)</i>
<p>
``But this is The House of the Lord'' protests the Older And Braver Of The Two. (I think we need a Glen Baxter illustration at this point).
<p>
Sir David sighs wearily (he's heard this sort of thing before)<p>
``No, madam; this is <i>King's College Chapel</i>''
