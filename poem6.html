<p>

Alone we are born
<br>
And die alone
<br>
Yet see the red-gold cirrus
<br>
over snow-mountain shine.
<br>

<br> 

Upon the upland road <br> Ride easy, stranger <br> Surrender to the
sky <br> Your heart of anger.  <br> <hr> James K. Baxter <hr> Jimmy
Baxter (``John. K. Oxter'') is New Zealand's most famous poet.  He was
a man of great gifts and considerable charm, but he was far too
prolific and was a hopeless critic of his own work.  He was a cult
figure to NZ radicals of my generation, as the rather Buddhist tone of
this poem might indeed have led one to expect, but he was in fact a
catholic convert and had the full set of tiresome habits that go with
it.  <p>

Every New Zealander of a certain age has this poem by heart. I do, for one.
