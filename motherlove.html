<hr>
Pues and&aacute;is en las palmas,<br>
&aacute;ngeles santos,<br>
que se duerme mi ni&ntilde;o,<br>
tened los ramos.

<p>

Palmas de Bel&eacute;n<br>
que mueven airados<br>
los furiosos vientos<br>
que suenan tanto:<br>
no le hag&aacute;is ruido,<br>
corred m&aacute;s paso,<br>
que se duerme mi ni&ntilde;o,<br>
tened los ramos.

<p>

El ni&ntilde;o divino,<br>
que est&aacute; cansado<br>
de llorar en la tierra<br>
por su descanso,<br>
sosegar quiere un poco<br>
del tierno llanto.<br>
Que se duerme mi ni&ntilde;o,<br>
tened los ramos.

<p>

Rigurosos yelos<br>
le est&aacute;n cercando;<br>
ya veis que no tengo<br>
con qu&eacute; guardarlo.<br>
&Aacute;ngeles divinos<br>
que v&aacute;is volando,<br>
que se duerme mi ni&ntilde;o,<br>
tened los ramos.

(It's obvious that the singer is the Virgin Mary, even if this fact is
not set out explicitly.) <br>Strange that the most wonderful poem
about mother-love should have been written by a man, and then set to
music by three men. (Three wise men?).  And two of those men (Wolf and
Brahms) were childless.  Not sure about Toldr&agrave;.  Has any female
composer set it...? <br>(While we are about it, nobody ever seems to
comment on the bizarre fact that <i>Frauenlieben und Leben</i> is a
set of poems written by a man and set to music by another man!(?) I
know of at least one gay tenor who would love to include it in a
concert!)  <p> I knew the Brahms setting long before I knew the
Toldr&agrave;. At the end of the GUNGADIN project (in about 1981) my
friend David and I (who had been working on it full blast for
<i>months</i>) had a week off to recover and went to stay at <A HREF
="scintillae.html">Maurice</A> and <A HREF
="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilynn_Webb"> Marilynn</A>'s place
``at the lake'' as we used to say: <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mahinerangi">Lake
Mahinarangi</A>.  Maurice had an LP (then just recently released) of
Janet Baker and Cecil Aronowitz and Andr&eacute; Previn playing <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpgav4yAUv8">the two songs with
viola plus the <i>Vier Ernste Ges&auml;nge</i>.</A> And of course the
second of the two songs with viola is a setting of the (translation
into German of the) above Lope de Vega text.  Maurice and Marilynn
were there with <A HREF
="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Webb_(artist)"> Ben </A> (their
child) and David and me.  The autumnal quality of the viola songs
matched the autumnal weather perfectly, and we spent days on end (how
many?) off our faces on Maurice's best weed (bless him) sitting among
the scrub by this isolated lake in the Otago steppe (not another house
for miles) listening to this wonderful music in a wonderful Otago
autumn.  And there is no autumn like an Otago autumn.  The perfect
restorative experience.  <hr> Not the least remarkable thing about
this poem is the circumstance that this is the only instance i know of
where Wolf set a poem also set by someone else and came off
second-best.  But he didn't come off second-best to <i>Brahms</i>: the
best setting of this text is by someone I had never heard of outside
this context: <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Toldr%C3%A0">Eduard
Toldr&agrave;</A>.  By some reckoning Wolf comes off
<i>third</i>-best.  The Toldr&agrave; setting is magic: <A HREF
