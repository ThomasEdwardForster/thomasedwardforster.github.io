<p>

<br>
Strange to know nothing, never to be sure
<br>
Of what is right, or true, or real
<br>
But forced to qualify:  <i>Or so I feel</i>
<br>
Or:  <i>Well, it does seem so,
<br>
Someone must know</i>
<br>

<br>

Strange to be ignorant of the way things work
<br>
Their skill at finding what they need,
<br>
Their sense of shape, and punctual spread of seed
<br>
And willingness to change
<br>
Yes, it is strange

<br>
<br>

Even to wear such knowledge&mdash;for our flesh
<br>
surrounds us with its own decisions&mdash;
<br>
and yet spend all our lives on imprecisions,
<br>
that when we start to die
<br>
have no idea why.

<hr> Philip Larkin <hr> Philip Larkin is the greatest vernacular poet
  in English of the twentieth century.  Or was he?  Does being a
  miserable git (and a gravely ideologically challenged miserable git
  at that, one might add) prevent you from being a great poet?

<hr>

This is a poem of such dazzling cleverness one really does not know
where to begin.  One tiny, <i> tiny</i> point: compare the two occurrences
of the word `or' in lines 3 and 4.  The first one appears <i> inside
</i> the quoted text, and the other <i>outside</i> it.  Yet they sound the same....
<hr>
Not all poems need to be read aloud; I think this one does....something to do with Larkin being a vernacular poet.
