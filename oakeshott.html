<hr>

``To be conservative, then, is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to
prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the
possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the
sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect,
present laughter to utopian bliss.

<hr> No it isn't, it is to protect the haves against the tiresome
importunacies of the have-nots.  It is to enforce what Michael Frayn
calls <i>the Tyranny of the Fortunate.</i>
<p>

This is the kind of thing that really annoys me. Tories are forever
coming up with crap like this. The Olympian, sagacious pose; the
frivolous refusal to engage with the legitimate concerns of the people
with whom you are contrasting yourself. Look how cool and sane and
reasonable I am.  Narcissistic twaddle.  Self-congratulation
masquerading as philosophy.  Enough to make a man Wallace.

<p> Apologias for
conservatism always do this. Trying to annex universal virtues as
their own distinctive contribution.
<p>
And yet, wouldn't it be wonderful to live in a world where the view
depicted above was a sensible and moral view to take? As my Otago
colleague <A HREF="https://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/dept/staff-pigden.html"> Charles Pigden </A> says <p> ``I'd
<i>love</i> to be a tory.''
