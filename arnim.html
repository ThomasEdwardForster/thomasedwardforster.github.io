Bei Quine gibt es die gro&szlig;e Klarheiten und die gro&szlig;e <i>Un</i>klarheiten.

<hr> Agreed. But actually, this is probably true about all sorts of great
writers.  <p>
 I have been increasingly of the view that
Quine the philosopher is overrated and Quine the logician is
underrated.

Quine the philosopher is pretty damn' good, but he plays to a large and
appreciative audience; Quine the Logician is arguably better, but he plays
to a much smaller audience.  Quine's philosophy of science is obscure, but
his philosophical logic is a model of clarity, and he was enduringly,
reverberatingly and frequently <i>annoyingly</i> right about (tedious)
basics that were often (and still are often) treated with culpable
sloppiness <i> by people who ought to know better </i>. Use/mention...
that kind of thing. He is important to us beco's he cared about things
that mattered, and &mdash; in the teeth of contemporary poor practice &mdash;
<i>he got them right</i>.




It may be true, as <A HREF="https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/dana-scott">
Dana Scott</A> says, that Quine didn't know any Model Theory to speak of, but he
did invent prime implicants, breadth-first and depth-first search (among other
things) and he thought very hard about Synonymy.  His work on Quasi-quotation
is important, fundamental and all his own work.  Read the chapter in <i> Mathematical Logic</i>.

<p> It's almost certainly something to do with him
being a language buff. He was one of only two people I have ever met
who (while not being linguists or polynesians) pronounced the glottal
stop in ``Hawai'i''. (The other is <A HREF ="https://www.devex.com/people/nigel-r-526791">Nigel
Rockliffe</A>).<p>

<hr> I have recently discovered that there are people other than me
that think that Quine the Philosopher is overrated and Quine the
Logician underrated, <A HREF =
"https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/AVisser"> Albert Visser</A> for one.
Visser is a star, and has done some very important work on synonymy (a
fuse that Quine lit).  And he should have his own entry in <i>Bon
Mot of the week</i>, for his observation that he is a subscriber to
the <i>Rorschach blot</i> theory of the Tractatus.  Say no more.<p>
Actually, while we are on the subject of the Tractatus, i once held in my hands the copy that W gave to Francis Skinner, with the inscription ``To Francis, with all my love''<hr>
