A fourteen year old girl goes to a hop.  A boy a few years older than her tries to pick her up: <br> 
``Are you a virgin?'' he asks. Our fourteen year old is of course quite properly innocent of <br>
these matters, but she does at least know that <i>either</i> `virgin' means that you <i>have</i> done
it, <br> or that you <i>haven't</i> &mdash;
but she cannot for the life of her remember which.  Oh yes, she also <br> knows that she
has <i>no</i> intention whatever of going to bed  with him: that much is clear.<br>
Intending to send a strongly and unmistakably negative message, she folds her
arms and says, <br> very  firmly, `<i>No!</i>' lest anyone get the wrong idea.
<hr>
I have this first-hand from the fourteen-year old in question, years later.

One could not ask for a better example of the kind of trouble one gets into by pretending one <br> 
knows something one doesn't. I always tell my students that, when they start teaching, and a <br> 
student asks them a question to which they do not know the answer, <i>they should say so</i>.  Your <br> 
students can tell perfectly well if you are flailing around in the dark, and they won't respect <br> 
you for trying to pretend you aren't.<br>
And that's not the only reason.  By acknowledging to them something they already believe to <br> be true, you  
are validating their judgement; by admitting an error you show yourself to be  <br>big enuff to
own up, and you earn their respect.  Further, there is no point in even <i>attempting</i> to <br> nurture in them  the illusion that their teachers know everything (!).

<p>When i was about eight, and starting latin, my latin teacher did a
 translation from English into <br>
 Latin on the board.  I put my hand up: ``Please sir, that should be 'suus' not 'eius' ''&mdash;and he bit my <br> head
 off.  <i>Who is taking this lesson??  Do you know better than me?</i> And
 more of the same, <i>much</i> <br> more; i was humiliated and torn into
 shreds in front of the whole class.

<br> But i was right. <i>Of Course</i> i was right; the eight-year-old
that is going to grow up to be a mathematical <br> logician has no
difficulty whatever with the difference between <i>suus</i> and
<i>eius</i>. And I knew i was right, <br> what's more, and i was
distraught beco's the world was not functioning properly: this grownup
who was <br> supposed to know better then me didn't. <br> But five
minutes later Mr Lyne (for it was he) suddenly turned to me and said:
``I'm sorry&mdash; you were<br> absolutely right!  Sorry, sorry!''
<br> As a result of this i remember him with great affection. We all
make mistakes, but he was big enough<br> to admit it. And it taught me
a lesson: i, too, can and should be big enough to admit it when i've
got it <br> wrong.  As should we all.  Thank you Mr Lyne.

I have just been reminded by a colleague that it took the Church 350 years to admit that they <br> got it wrong over Galileo.  The delay doesn't make them look resolute; it makes them <br> look foolish&mdash;by suggesting that the truth of the matter is in their gift. <hr>

Incidentally, on this subject of admitting that you don't know, has it
ever struck you, Dear Reader,<br> that it is <i>precisely</i> the things
about which we are most uncertain [and about which we should <br>therefore
be the least censorious] about which we are in fact the most dogmatic?
The errors <br> for whose commission humans are the most willing to murder
other humans are precisely the <br> errors which it is easiest to make?
And they all concern religion?   Why is it that religious people <br> -
unlike the rest of us &mdash; cannot simply admit that they haven't a clue?
<br> The great mystery of the human condition is that our whole access
to mother nature is through <br> stuff which &mdash; according to materialism &mdash;
is a mere epiphenomenon. About this great &mdash; <i>fundamental</i>&mdash;mystery
religion has nothing whatever to say &mdash; let alone anything authoritative.
