<p>  You know you've grown up when you think that your Ph.D. thesis isn't that bad after all.

But then, as my psychoanalyst friend Paul Ries says:
<hr>


<p>``Nobody ever grows up; there simply isn't time''.

Max Cresswell is also responsible for the only decent
Philosopher-lightbulb joke.  Over tea one morning in the department
at Vic someone was saying that there ought to be a <i>Philosopher</i>
lightbulb joke.  The punch line of course would have to be ``It all
depends what you mean by a light-bulb'' and when this point was made Max made as if
to pick up a light-bulb and wave it in the air. ``Well'', he said
``what <i>do</i> I mean by a lightbulb?''...... thereby illustrating 
another <i>bon mot</i> of his:<p>
``The difference between logicians and mathematicians is that logicians understand the use-mention distinction''.

Years ago, when we were Ph.D. students i mentioned this to 
<A HREF ="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/phk1e12.page">Peter Kropholler </A> and he said<hr>
``What is the use-mention distinction?''
<hr>
co's he's a <i> mathematician.</i>
