<i> Brian's Mother:</i>  He's not the Messiah: he's a very naughty boy!  
Now go away!

<p> There are too many delights to be found in Python for one to hope
to even begin to enumerate them all.  This observation of Brian's
Mother is apparently one of the most famous and best-loved lines in
modern cinema, and it's worth asking why.  Like many apparent extreme
radicals in the Arts, Python turns out on closer inspection to have a
deep respect for classical forms.  Here we see a wonderful case of
dramatic irony.  We, the audience, know that Brian is not the Messiah
(this was made clear in the nativity scene at the beginning, where the
Magi leave Brian's crib for the crib of the real Messiah) but it is
quite clear that Brian's mother does not see the significance of this
scene and altho' she has a pretty shrewd idea that Brian is not the
Messiah she doesn't actually <i>know</i> it. Unlike us!  Dramatic
irony is surely the basis of the appeal of this line. [actually, i'm
no longer convinced.  It's in part Bathos.]<p>


There is a delightful sequel to this. Malcolm Muggeridge was invited 
onto a TV Arts programme to discuss <i> Brian</i>.  There had been a 
showing before the discussion of course, but Muggeridge missed the 
beginning of it &mdash; in particular the nativity scene (wherein it is made 
clear that Brian is <i>not</i> the Messiah) &mdash; because of a good 
lunch, and then (having completely missed the crucial point) went on TV 
afterwards to complain about the blasphemous nature of the film...
thereby inadvertently providing us with another piece of dramatic irony: 
<i> he</i> doesn't know that Brian isn't the Messiah but 
we do.  Nature imitating art. Would he have appreciated this
line if he had actually seen the whole of the film?  One suspects not:
<i> Brian </i> would probably have exhausted his limited critical faculties
in any case.
