<hr>

Twelve lectures in Easter term.  M W F 10:00 MR 5<br>
<hr>
There are two reasons for this course to be proposed.  One is the lecturer's long-standing intention to write a textbook on this subject; however the <i>proximate </i> impetus for this lecture course is a meeting on this
topic in Dagstuhl in the third week of january - immediately preceding
the lectures here in Cambridge.  Inevitably the choice of material
will be strongly affected by the events in Dagstuhl, so the details of
precisely what is to be covered will be the result of a rather
last-minute decision.  Nevertheless the long-running desire to write a textbook has resulted in <A HREF = "BQObok.pdf"> some notes</A>.
