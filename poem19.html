<p>
      Whatever is will have no end
<br>      although denied by foe or friend
<br>
      and this I say to friend and foe
<br>
      as onward to the grave we go

      The candle in my little room
<br>
      gives light but will not bake the host
<br>
      I share my certainty with Hume
<br>
      The candle with the Holy Ghost.

  A.R.D.Fairbairn <hr> I suppose what I really like about this poem is
the way it manages to keep on board the values both of Romanticism and
of the Enlightenment.  (My simple mind also likes the fact that it
rhymes and scans).  At the start of the twenty-first century the
values of the Enlightenment are under concerted attack from some of
the loonier children of romanticism. The poisonous certainty of Romanticism 
fuelled the fundamentalism of the People Of The Book, and Nazism, which made the Twentieth century such a jolly affair, and it is set to sabotage the third millenium as well.  And yet one wants to save at
least <i>some</i> romantics from the flames: a world without William
Blake doesn't bear thinking about.  <p> Rex Fairbairn is underregarded
nowadays, like so many of the NZ poets of his generation.  One reason
why his reputation was always going to be vulnerable to eclipse was
that he wrote too much, and often at too great length. That's not a
problem here!
