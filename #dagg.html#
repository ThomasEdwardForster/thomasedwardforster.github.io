Me father-in-law's been feeling<br>
        pretty pleased with himself:<br>
He's been living in Greece<br>
        for the good of his health.<br>
I said, "How was the climate?<br>
        And how was your year?"<br>
He says, "The climate's too hot,<br>
        you can't get a beer,<br>
The sheilas look like blokes, and of course<br>
        the blokes are all queer,<br>
The Turks and the Arabs<br>
        well they live far too near<br>
and if you want a really <i>good</i> time,<br>
        you might as well live here."<br>
He says:  We don't know how lucky we are, Fred<br>
We don't know   how lucky     we are<p>

I was down the Plough and Chequebook,<br>
        the night before last<br>
There's a guy down there on the floor<br>
        with his brain at half-mast<br>
I said "You're looking really bad mate<br>
        your eyes look like strings"<br>
He says "Get me an eight will you, Fred<br>
        I can't see a thing"<p>

        We don't know how lucky we are,      mate<br>
        We don't know how lucky we are,<p>

Me stock agent's got a beach place<br>
        where he spends most of his days<br>
His wife bit the dust down there last year<br>
        got eaten by a couple of crays<br>
And his two littlest daughters<br>
        got killed by a whale<br>
I said "Are you going down there this year mate?"<br>
        He says "Fred, right on the nail"<br>

        "We don't know how fortunate we are to have that place<br>
        We don't know how propitious are the circumstances Frederick"<p>

So if things are looking really bad<br>
        you're thinking of givin' it away<br>
Remember New Zealand's a cracker<br>
        and I reckon come what may<br>
If things get appallingly bad<br>
        and we all get atrociously poor<br>
If we stand in the queue with our hats on<br>
        we can borrow a few million more.<br>

        We don't know how lucky we are,      mate<br>
        We don't know how lucky we are.<br>

Fred Dagg, mid 1970's
<hr>
Indeed we don't, but we are starting to learn. <p>

An ``eight'' is an 8oz jug of beer.  <hr> Fred Dagg, aka John Clarke,
was a hugely underemployed talent. Spent most of his working life
entertaining a larger market across the ditch.  A voice from the more
innocent 1970's (his character's views on mediterraneans would now be
felt to be racist) speaking to us (in 2019) with sobering
prescience.<br> One of his great talents was an ear for NZ vernacular,
as in:<p>

We three kings of Orient are<br>
One in a tractor one in a car<br>
One on a scooter <br>
blowing his hooter <br>
following yonder star<p>

Oh, Oh - star of wonder, star of light<br>
star of beauty she'll be right<br>
star of glory <br>
that's the story <br>
following yonder star.
