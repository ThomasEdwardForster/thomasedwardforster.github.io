        <FONT SIZE="+2">Online Materials</FONT></TD> <hr> There is a
wealth of material on the web, and I can be quite sure that you will
discover sites that look useful.  Whenever you find one, please tell
me about it: if it is bad I want to be able to warn you against it,
and if it is good I want to be able to tell the other students.  By
all means make use of the online materials, but do bear in mind that
there is a wealth of differing notations out there in the electronic
jungle, and I shall be expecting answers to questions in the two tests
to be provided in the style used in the lectures and the notes that
accompany them. <br>

Dear Thomas:
<br>
You may look at the web-based course ``Logic & Proofs'' I have been
developing over the last few years. You can either go to the 
<br>
<A HREF ="http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/apros/index.php">  AProS homepage </A> 

<br>
and from there to the ``free and open version'' of the sentential logical
half of the course or directly to
<br>
<A HREF ="http://www.cmu.edu/oli/courses/enter_logic.html"> Logic at CMU  </A> .
<br>
The first path has the advantage of informing you about the context in
which the course is evolving.
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Wilfried

I haven't had time to even look at 
<A HREF ="http://www.hatzicware.com/joomla/">this one </A> .
<hr>
In previous years I have used
<A HREF ="http://users.comlab.ox.ac.uk/bernard.sufrin/jape.html"> JAPE </A>.  It does box proofs not tree proofs but you might find it helpful. 
<br>
(Some JAPE hints: alt-press-drag to create a new world. The only 'theory' it
works with is natural_deduction/I2L.jt. If you want it to work
with anything else, you have to incorporate I2L_disproof.j)

A message from Ryan Walker about a nice URL he found:<p>


<A HREF ="http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/apros/index.php?page=generator&subpage=proofdisplay">Here's the link to the application:</A>
<p>

A few instructions:
<p>
Just click on the "Launch ProofDisplay - Version 1.6.5" link under the
headline "Java Web Start Download", if you have version 1.5.0 of Java
(which you should already have - it automatically updates itself).
<p>
When the application is open, there's a main input field called "Input
Assertion".. if you look at the far right hand side, you'll see a round
button called edit. If you click that you'll get an assertion editor
window, as well as the symbols we use (not, &, or, implies,
biconditional, for all, exists). Once you've input your goal, you can
click save, then click on the arrow button on the same Insert Assertion
line to run the proof search and display the results.
