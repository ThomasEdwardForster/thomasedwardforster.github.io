<p><i> Benjamin Franklin is becalmed at sea between Boston and New York and food is running low. Now read on....</i> <p>
    ....our people set about catching cod, and haul'd up a
    great many.  Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution of
    not eating animal food, and on this occasion I consider'd, with my
master Tryon, the
    taking of every fish as a kind of unprovok'd murder,
    since none of them had or ever could do us any injury
    that might justify the slaughter.  All this seemed very
    reasonable.  But I had formerly been a great lover of
    fish & when this came hot out of the frying pan, it
    smelt admirably well.  I balanced some time between
    principle and inclination till I recollected that when
    the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish in their stomachs. 
    Then, tho'rt I, if you eat one another, I don't see why
    I mayn't eat you.  So I din'd upon cod very heartily,
    and continued to eat  it with other people, returning
    only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. <p>
    So convenient a thing it is to be a <i>Reasonable Creature</i>,
    since it enables one to find or make a reason for every
    thing one has a mind to do. <p>

Benjamin Franklin, Autobiography. (And yes, it's his spelling, his
italicisation and his punctuation - not mine!)  <p>
Yes, reasons can always be found.  Isn't there something like this
in Hume..? ``Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions''<p>
Anyway, his master <A HREF ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tryon">Tryon </A>was a
seventeenth century English writer, whose writing converted the
16-year-old Benjamin Franklin to vegetarianism, as the latter records
in earlier pages in his autobiography.<p>
Incidentally if you haven't read Franklin's autobiography, you must.
It's a bit reminiscent of Hume .. the understated irony, the humanity.
And &mdash; like Hume &mdash; occasionally <i>very</i> funny.
A pure delight.
