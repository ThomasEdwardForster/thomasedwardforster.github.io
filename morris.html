Never have in your house anything you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful

Monja Danischewski was a neighbour of ours when i was a child in Highgate (in those days ordinary middle-class people could afford to live in Highgate Village).  He directed (produced?)<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky_Galore!_(1949_film)"><i>Whiskey Galore</i></A> and tells various hilarious stories about his interactions with locals.  The theme to most of these stories
was that these islanders were infinitely sharper than these smug Hampstead &mdash;well&mdash; <i>Highgate</i> townies were prepared for.  On one occasion one elderly local approached Danischewski and seid to him (you have to imagine the hebridean accent, with its very precise diction).
<p>
I believe, sir that you are Russian
<p>
Danischewski agreed that yes, he was.
<p>
Can you tell me, perhaps, why jealousy is such a constantly recurring theme among Tolstoi's heroines?

On another occasion Danischewski asked one of them if they had a Gaelic expression corresponding to <i> ma&ntilde;ana </i>, explaining that it meant ``I'll put it off till tomorrow'' (his interlocutor had no spanish) and got the thoughtful reply  <p> ``I don't think we have anything that quite conveys that sense of urgency''
