<b>Health warning:</b><br>

These notes started off as <i>my</i> notes - for lecturing <i>from</i> - 
when I was lecturing DM at Queen Mary, and in making them available to
my supervisees I offer no guarantees.  Word has reached me that
Cambridge 1a CS students refer to these notes, so I have tidied them
up a bit. Notification of typos, etc, suggestions for improvement,
etc, will be received with thanks and attract the usual rewards.<br>
<b>If I am supervising you for 1A Discrete Maths I want you to read 
these notes and attempt all the  exercises</b>.<br> <hr> You might find
<A HREF ="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jean/gbooks/discmath.html"> Jean Gallier's lecture notes on first-year discrete maths for CS students </A> helpful.<hr> 
Here are my <A HREF ="languages-and-automata.pdf">Regular Languages
and Finite Automata </A> materials (originally written for Queen Mary)
in pdf format.  I am greatly endebted to Chlo&euml; Brown for creating
a <A HREF ="langs-and-automata/main.html"> version in html </A>.  This
version is preferable in various ways to the pdf version, since the
answers to the exercises are not immediately visible in the way they
are in the .pdf version, but can be seen only when you click on the
link.  Thank you, Chlo&euml; Brown!! Here <A HREF ="112coursework2answers.pdf">
is a file of answers to the coursework questions at the end </A>.

<b>ASSORTED EXERCISES</b> <hr>
<A HREF= "discex.pdf"> Here </A> is a file containing lots of exercises.  You should certainly attempt at least some of them, tho' some of them (for example the structured proof exercises) pertain to material that is not currently lectured. Some of them have answers prepared by my supervisees, and displayed below. Here are <br>
<A HREF ="basuita.ps"> Simrun Basuita's answer to question 3</A> of 
the section on structured proof; <br>
<A HREF ="bakerdiscreteexercise.pdf"> James Baker's
answer to question 6 </A> 
in that section; and <br>
<A HREF ="bakerproof6.pdf"> James Baker's
answer to question 7 </A> 
in that section.

<b>ASSORTED OTHER MATERIALS</b> <hr>
I think you will find these <A HREF
="discrete-trial-101-test.pdf">exercises on matrix representation of
binary relations</A> very useful.  They are elementary, and you need -
eventually! - to be able to do them all without breaking sweat.  Don't
feel any need to do the whole lot, but try a random sample to make sure you're OK.<hr> <A HREF
="structuralinductionexercise.pdf">An exercise on structural
induction</A>.  <hr> You presumably know what a Necker cube is.  Cook
up a bundle of literals that say things like...whether or not [in the
3D reconstruction] a line segment lies in the plane of the paper or in
a plane normal to it.  Oh yes, and something about what happens when
two lines cross.  The idea will be that you will have a big fat
formula with lots of literals in it and there will be precisely two
valuations that make the formula true, corresponding to the two
possible orientations of the cube in the reconstruction. I have a
discussion answer which I will show you if you attempt the exercise.

<A HREF ="keeping_out_of_mischief.htm"> Here </A> is Gary Jackson's html-ised
illustrated discussion of the handshaking riddle. <hr>

Here is a <A HREF ="Induction.pdf"> worked example of a proof by
course-of-values induction</A>, prepared by Frank King, and included
with his permission.  <hr> Here is a <A HREF ="countability.pdf"> file
</A> that contains everything you need to know about countability.  It
also has some instructive exercises.  You can skip the appendix if you
like but you should definitely read everything before it.

 <A HREF ="discretenotes.pdf"> Here </A> is a discussion of some of the exercises in the 2012-3 lecture notes for DMI and DMII.<br>

       <FONT SIZE="+1"> <A HREF ="http://www.japeforall.org.uk"> JAPE </A> (``Just Another Proof Editor'') is a gadget that is no longer examinable, but it can be very useful as long as you don't become addicted to it. It was developed in part by Richard Bornat, then at QMW, and <A HREF ="bornat-on-JAPE.pdf"> here</A> is his introduction....it may be useful (the exercises I supply invite you to use it).   In any case it anticipates the 1b course: <i>Logic and Proof</i>.

<A HREF ="compsci_notes.pdf"> Here 
</A> are my supervision notes for assorted CS topics (and not
just 1a).  They are messages to myself, and come with no guarantees.
The chapters on ML and discrete mathematics might be helpful.

<A HREF = "dualityquestion.pdf"> This </A> is a model tripos question for ....  well, i'm not sure.  It just might be a teeny bit hard for 1a discrete maths but is probably too easy for 1b.<hr>



If you are interested in Linear Logic then <A HREF = "http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/llgames.pdf"> Andreas Blass's notes on Linear Logic</A> is as good a place to start as any.
